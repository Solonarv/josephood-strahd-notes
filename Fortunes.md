eva takes the larger deck and starts shuffling it again. she then pulls three cards off of it and puts them in front of us.

eva looks at oliver, slowly and carefully flips a card: The Monk, 1 of Glyphs. the words of the divine fal on deaf ears, baffled by the shadow mists. find the damned one in his place of worship, and free his divine soul from the madness of mortality. she gives him the card. O: bit strange but i think i get it. she smiles.

jasper: The Swashbuckler, 1st of Coins. Alas! I see swirling snow and frigid ice. The reaper's shadow grows long, and moutaintops ring with pleas of a lost soul. J: that doesnt mean a lot to me im sorry. She sighs, understandingly (vibe: I know as much as you do).

Quiyra and Areia: sad sigh, as if pitying. The Necromancer, 8 of Stars. arrow of time moves ever forward, but the warp of magic can render new life to souls of the dead through its weave.
follow light of corpse star, in the place where amber giants sleep.
