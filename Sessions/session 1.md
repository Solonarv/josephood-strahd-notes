## Day -1
we're all trevaling  to daggerford
looking for nightmare's stable, a tavern

arrive around 6 pm, sunset

areia and oliver enter first, they see:

standard tavern, pretty empty
which is a bit offputting at this time
but there was little traffic outside in the first place

only person in there is the barkeep, a human, 40ish, bald head/long on sides, long goatee, quite the beer belly, plump.

greets with a smile, welcoming. areia & oliver sit at a table, get water to drink.

descriptions:

oliver: pretty tall human, red eyes white skin, dark black hair, dressed in clerical clothing -more gray than the usual black - , symbol of kelemvor around neck

areia: tiefling, basically crop top & leggings, lightgreen hair, red horns, piercings on horns, human tone skin, orange eyes, many tats&piercings. necklace with two rings on it. only carrying a dagger. fit/toned, not jacked.

they're waiting for someone.

barkeep asks them to try some dried apple snacks he wants to try selling. areia is a tad suspicious

as they talk, jasper arrives

medium-tall half elf, brown eyes, traveling coat, looks kinda like a vagrant, obviously wearing armor under it. followed by a walking chest(?). 

he shows his card, introductions happen. oliver/areia have cards too.

barkeep notices jasper arrived, asks if he wants something to drink. he gets a light beer.

quiyra arrives too. introductions. 

shortly after, more people start coming in. as if quiyra was the last one that had to arrive and now the tavern can start working properly. barkeep loses track of our table.

one weird person arrives

man, long greasy hair, dressed almost like a harlequin, approaches our table with a smile framed by a thin beard. smug look on his face: he knows we're expecting him.

his name: jasper (what a coincidence)

he and the dream voice belong to the same people, but havent seen each other in a while. she speaks to them, mainly in dreams, and only rarely asks for message delivery. he doesn't want to impose on us, so if we had more to do here he wouldn't press us.

we're going to their camp. there's a party there, with food and drink.

he says areia looks like an acrobat/actor. she is; he says she may have fun performing.

oliver leaves a note to the barkeep: add honey to the apples!

we follow him out. walking at a steady pace, not looking back.

out the south gate of daggerford. after 5 minutes of chat about how oddly not cryptic this is...

going into the forest, deep. we'll hear music soon, or now if we have fine ears.
undeveloped forest, no path.

we hear faint guitar tones from the distance. as we continue, gets louder, more audible, more distinct.


we are, as jasper said, coming in through the back of the camp. ~20 people here: playing music, dancing, some are fighting barefisted, having a good time. big fire at center, 4 carriages with 2 horses each. horses tied to trees nearby. opposite side of where we arrive, path that has been cleared.

as we approach, jasper opens his arms in welcome. 

we sit on tree stumps. people bring us food and drink. we take some, varying amounts. the people don't seem to care how much we take, whether a little or a lot.

no clear roles among them. everyone dressed like jasper. quite tan/olive skin, mediterranean-ish. they've clearly dressed up for this, extra nice clothes, makeup: clearly this has been prepared for someone (us).

jasper (ours) taking notes, drawing sketches. askign questions. they are vistani, form everywhere; this is a regular occurence, they like parties. this one specifically is pretty special: they were told to expect four people (us).

their music is fast and frantic; the dancers' movements make their clothes swirl and swoosh.

near the fire is calmer: it's where people are just chilling, talking, telling stories.

at the moment, a man is speaking: narrating the story of a group of adventureres who met n a small city, to the desert, other planes of existence, a heroic story. they don't mention our arrival, just scoot to make space for us.

story ends, old man approaches us. he looks different. still wears bright colors, but simpler. smiles at us. madam eva told them to greet us, and ask for a favor. his name: tanimir. he asks our names, we introduce ourselves. he says: pleasure to meet us. he shouts for the music to quiet, people stop playing and dancing.

there's a story he has to tell, can't with all this noise. he sits.

do we have stories to tell?

q: the recent one, she's not ready to tell

boat thought madam eva would have told them more. but no, all they knew is to wait for us and tell us this story, then ask us to travel with them for a bit.

the place they're taking us is not on the farun maps. are we familiar with interplanar travel? mostly: only distantnyl.

the place he's talking about is called barovia. a dead and cursed land. a place that has gone through many hardships. for some reason, unknown to him, it's calling us now. he picks up a flask. he spits wine from the flask into the fire, which turns green.

a dark shape appears in the bonfire. they come from an ancient land, name long forgotten. a land of kings. ther enemies forced them from their homes, now they wander the lost roads.

dark shape takes form of man knocked from horse, spear piercing his side.

one night, wounded soldier staggered into camp and collapsed. they noticed his injury and took care of him. when asked who he was, he wouldnt say. he just wanted to return home. but, deep into land of his enemies. they took him in and followed him to his homeland. his enemies hunted him, but vistani didn't give him up, even when assassins came.

this man of royal blood fought to protect the vistani and they fought for him. he said: i owe you my life. stay as long as you like, know that you will always be safe here.

dark shape finished fight, dissipates.

a curse has befgallen their noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. they alone can leave his domain, and they traveled far and wide here. madam eva can 

will we return to barovia with them and talk to madam eva? he warns: we may never see the light of the sun again. 

areia asks: what does he mean? literally and figuratively, there is no sun in barovia, and people tend to die there. its dangerous.

hes not sure what madam eva wants us to do. he guesses kill the dark lord.

we accept, for various reasons. the old man is surprised, saying under his breath that he did not expect this answer.

for tonight, we are welcome to stay with them if we want. we'll leave tomorrow morning.

the party resumes at his instruction. he tells us to have fun; insert old man excuse here.

we talk, about our homes - only a little bit.

we exchange specialties, at jasper's suggestion.

areia: hitting things. with weapons.
jasper: fixes things, collects books, develops skills. uncommon skillset around here: an artificer.
oliver: some divine magic
quiyra: a druid.

the vistani seem to particularly like telling stories. quiyra joins in, telling some stories from the Time of Troubles.

everyone seems to be 30ish, except the old man.

as the night goes on, everyone goes to sleep. some have tents, some sleep in the carriages.

they don't carry weapons on their person, just pile them on near a specific tree. they don't mind ours though.

we get ready to sleep, or equivalent. the woods are silent, except for people speaking in hushed voices. one of the vistani approaches us, offers us to join any tent we see if we need a place to sleep. quiyra declines (elf), the other three accept.

night passes.
## Day 0
quiyra "wakes" first.

a few hours later, everyone else wakes too, gets out of the tents. quiet, still tired, some nursing hangovers.

old man tells us good morning. hopes we slept well; quiyra didn't, the rest did.

we can go on the last carriage, he'll go in the front with his sons.

they get ready for departure, quite efficiently. they're clearly used to this.

after some time, everything's ready and they invite us to jump on the last carraige. other jasper is in there with us.

old man yells an order, carriages start moving.

after a little time we go back to the main road, opposite side of how we came into the camp.

everyone's pretty quiet. jasper looks at us sadly. he knows what we'll face and feels sorry for us, by his expression.

he tells us farewell, expecting not to see us again.

we are apparently the first group to accept their request.

he says, "i hope you don't die."

quiyra turns into a cat, not wanting to talk.

after about an hour, the carriage begins to fill with a thick mist. jasper looks worried, suggests holding our breath. we do. shortly after, the mist gets so thick and dense that we don't even see the people in front of us. we can still find each other by touch, just can't see. those of us who can't hold our breaths hack and cougfh, the mist heavy in the lungs.

when the mist dissipared, the environment has changed. colours, chirping birds: gone. everything replaced by a sad palette of greens and grays. the land below us no longe rprocuding the pleasent sounds of carriage wheels on terrain, but now going through mud.

q stops being a cat and looks around. black pools of water, resembling dark mirrors, on and around roadway

dark trees around us, clawlike branches. "no sun" exaggeration, there is a sun, but behind heavy clouds. still enough to see normally though. one of those sad, gray, cloudy days. very humid. smell of recent rain, whiff of wet earth and grass.

jasper asks jasper where they're dropping us off. he says we're stopping at the gate, they can't go any further. they would like to, but his group has been exiled from barovia.

after we're dropped off, he suggests we stop at the village of barovia and then choose our own path. madam eva is at the zerapul encampment. advice: don't wader in the forest, keep your feet on the main road. forest full of beasts, mainly wolves. they share their sight with the... devil, dark lord, count strahd von zarovich. few people will utter that name, though

this is a land of many superstitions.

carriage stops. we disembark. ahead of us are high stone buttresses, huge iron gates hanging on the stonework, morning dew clings to the rusted bars. two giant headless statues of armed guardians flank the gates. heads rest at their feet. they greet us with silence.

we say our farewells, hoping that they're temporary. the vistani leave us. as soon as we move closer to the gates, they swing open of their own accord, emitting a piercing noise that makes nearby birds fly away.

we ready ourselves and go in. the road is muddy and the landscape not something too enjoyable. thick forest, big trees, not much sunlight. sad and depressing.

we walk for perhaps half an hour before we see something that stands out. an abandoned hamlet. some houses, ruined by the passing of time. we are surrounded by a thin veil of mist. the mist thickens, slowly.

on the end of the hamlet is a lit lantern sitting on a porch. we go there.

outside of it, in front of the door, are two children. theyre wearing nice cloaks. noble, perhaps. a small boy and a girl. they wave at us.

oliver says hi to them, do they know where the nearest town is? the girl points somewhere, says we'll find it that way.

we ask if they're alright, they say yes. their parents are fighting monsters in the cellar. the parents always send the kids away for these fights.

baby crying on second floor. boy pulls on girl's sleeve, whispers to her. she looks at us and asks if we could check on their brother.

q summons an owl and sends it up to look through the 2nd floor window. a bedroom; double bedroom; no baby visible, but another door in there. the crying comes from that door.

is there anything in the house we shouldn't see? the monsters, in the cellar.

q casts PWT

fine wood, oil lamps, shield emblazoned with coat of arms: golden windmill on red field
stern portraits of stone-faced aristocrats
in front of us: mahogany doors. clearly a noble house.

we open them, main hall. black marble fireplace, red marble staircase. above fireplace: longsword with windmill cameo in the hilt. wood-paneled walls sculpted: fine flowers, nymphs, satyrs. areia wants the sword "so bad"

we go up the stairs. the general state worsens: first floor pristine, clean, clear; second floor looks lived-in, some cobwebs, not as clean. oil lamps above the four armors.

on one wall is a portrait of a family, incl. the two children. the armors' helmets are shaped like wolf heads.

we go up another floor, to where the baby is. really bad, dusty, dirty, nobody seems to care about it. we can hear crying. there are four doors. we go through one.

bedroom, dusty and cobwebbed, adjoining room, balcony, double bed with two nightstands, wardrobe: servants' clothing, uniforms. full-height mirror

adjoining room is nursery. crib covered by black shroud. crying coming from the crib. oliver goes to pull the cloth back, but as he does, we all see a figure appearing out of thin air in the room. translucent image of a woman, who looks at us, holding finger up to lips: "baby is sleeping, pls no wake". jasper holds the cloth, inside the crib is a tightly wrapper baby-sized bundle. she walks toward the crib, we all get out of their way.

the ghost reaches inside the crib, she gestures as if picking up the baby. as she does, the bundle unfolds, revealing nothing. she behaves as if she's holding a baby, though she's not. she returns to the room and walks into the mirror.

jasper pokes his head down the balcony, checking if the kids are still there. he hears footsteps, but is not sure if they belong to the kids. quiyra sends the owl out: yup, kids still there. the owl preens for the kids, they smile.

we decide to poke our heads around the house to get to the root of this.

next door: small storage room. folded sheets, blankets, broom, etc

next door, doubles: undead creature, not alive. hanging from the ceiling with a rope around its neck. gray skin, bloated. dressed nicely, or at least he once was. looks like the father in the portrait. rest of the room is cobwebbed, dusty master bedroom. burgundy drapes on dinwod, 4post bed with embroider curtains and matchinv eils, pair of empty wardrobes, vanity, rotting tigerskin rug, portrait of of the parents above the fireplace. little parlor with table, 2chairs, tea set.

we agree that we should double-tap the undead (which isn't moving). holds paper in right hand. hand is crisped with rigor mortis; oliver cuts it free.

note quote:
> My Beloved Children,
> I wish I could do what all fathers do and tell you that monsters aren’t real. But it wouldn’t be true.
> Life can create things of exquisite beauty. But it can also twist them into hideous beings. Selfish. Violent. Grotesque. Monstrous. It hurts me to say that your mother has turned into one such monster, inside and out. And I’m afraid the disease that afflicted her mind has taken hold of me as well.
> It sickens me to think what we’ve put you through. There is no excuse. I only ask you, though I know I have not the right to do so, to try and forgive us. I despise what your mother has become, but I love and pity her all the same.
> Rose, I wish I could see you blossom into a strong, beautiful woman. Thorn and Walter, I wish I could be there for you. But I can’t. This is the only way.
> Goodbye.

TL;DR mother turned into a monster, father is following. 

oliver checks out the room. jewelry box quite nice, contents: blabla. sealed letter.

letter says:
> My Dear Mrs. Petrovna,
> Your advice on dealing with the unwanted fiend in my home is quite good advice indeed. Tonight's ceremony will proceed as planned when the moon is at its highest peak - without, of course, the attendance of Mr. Durst. I must agree with you that, with the assistance of such a remarkably innocent subject, the results of our proceedings may be far improved. “Innocent," of course, is not quite the term I would use.
> If nothing else, I am relieved that I shall soon no longer have to suffer the harlot’s insufferable presence each time we must pass through her quarters to our meeting-space. We shall be well rid of her indeed.
> My Thanks,
> Mrs. Elisabeth Durst

last door on this level: bathroom

narrow door: pantry.

last door: several black cloaks, a top hat.

areia takes the sword from above the mantel.

areia and oliver lived together in baldur's gate.

jasper offers to check (via scratch test/smithy knowledge) if it might be magical. it isn't, just brand new.

no doors to the basement!?

jasper speculates: perhaps the way through is to the ghost mirror. but first we shall check the 1st floor.

door 1: servant's quarters. two beds with footlockers. closet with uniforms. footlockers empty. dumbwaiter leads here.

door 2: library. red velvet drapes on windows, exquisit mahogany desk+chair, framed picture of windmill atop rocky crag framed on top of fireplace, 2 stuffed chairs, 2 floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, rolling ladder to reach higher books.

jasper checks for expensive/valuable books. just a normal library, nothing special here. on top of one shelf is a small rock collection with scientific names.

candlelight flickering behind the bookshelf. q turns into a spider and slips in there to have a look.

2 bookshelves packed with tomes. heavy wooden chest, clawed iron feet. stickout of it: a skeleton in leather boots.

areia breaks the bookcase so we can go in there. she can do so easily.

chest contains: rest of the skeleton, which is holding a letter. also three books with black leather covers, three scrolls, two smaller scrolls, and another letter

held letter:
> has a crest on it (strahd's)
> My most pathetic servant,
> I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.
> You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
> Your dread lord and master,
> Strahd von Zarovich

chest letter:
> a will. everything in possession of Durst family - house, windmill, everything - goes to rosavalda and thornboldt (the kids).

the three books are blank. the three scrolls are spells: bless, prot from poison, spiritual weapon. the two smaller scrolls: deed to windmill ("situated in the mountains east of Vallaki"), deed to house.
