## Day 3, still

desk with lots of diagram-filled parchments
bookshelves with quite the collection

first thing victor does when entering the room: put (back) the book with the symbol

full-length mirror in the far corner, covered by a sheet.

victor asks what we know, quiyra reports.
she interrupts: is that the mirror here, by the way? - yes, it's no ordinary mirror. it's a window to the ethereal plane.

victor: if there was a way to bring her back, I would've done so already, but she is not dead.

he walks to the mirror, revealing it. it shows the normal reflection, plus a young girl, who seems to have noticed us. she waves shyly.

a: can she hear us? v: no, mirror only does vision.

her expression: uneasy. doesn't look fine, but not in acute distress.

v: she's been stuck here for the last two months.

o: how did this happen?
v: 3 months ago, heard that the devil had returned to the land. planned an escape. I found this book {points at spellbook}, which has incantations of teleportation. we began studying a way to escape from this place. 10 weeks ago, we finished writing a circle. at first we used undead rabbits for testing - I bought some bones and reanimated them using knowledge from the book -, but she wanted to be the first live human trial. I have no idea where her body was teleported, but I know for sure that her soul is stuck in the ethereal plane. I thought she was dead, but after two weeks, I was told that my parent's servants had seen the ghost of a young woman reflected in a mirror in my mother's room. I now know this is a so-called spirit mirror, which reflects material and ethereal plane both. we have been communicating through it since. at first, we tried lipreading and gestures, but eventually I found this book in my father's library {points at a small book}: it contains lessons to sign language, and since then I've been trying so hard to bring her back, but nothing seemed to work. She feels like she's slowly losing her memory, and even her figure is slowly growing more insubstantial. Sometimes she says she can't tell whether she's herself or someone else; she feels as if part of her is curled up in a warm and wet place, with a heartbeat echoing through the warmth.

All he wants to do now is fix his mistakes. He feels like there is little time left, her connection to her self growing weaker and weaker. She has perhaps only a little over a week left.

His only leads are: the book. He found the book in his father's library 3 years ago, and inside he found that the book belonged to a powerful mage named Khazan. He's been studying it since, and he knows that the mage built a tower in Barovia.

He's willing to bargain with us: we go to the tower and bring Victor what artifacts we can find.

We ask where the tower is: near Lake Baratok (sp?). Victor doesn't know how to get there, but Szoldar Szoldarovich (sp?) knows. The hunter lives in a hut near Lake Zarovich, where he skins the animals he hunts.

OOC clarification: Khazan's spellbook is the book that had the symbol on it.

Oliver explains why we're interested in the symbol: a little girl has gone missing, and the only lead is a ring with that symbol on it.

Oliver asks, in return for us going to the tower: lay off the necromancy.

He says he has told us all he knows, and we think he is being honest.

Quiyra asks: where is the hut, exactly? V: near the shore along the road, can't miss it.

We take our leave and go. As we walk out, we see in the corner of our eye that victor is conversing with the girl in the mirror, and he calls out "wait! She thinks I should tell you the whole plan".

He was plannign to tell us on our return, but she insisted on telling us now. He wants to restore her soul, and for this he has to physically enter the ethereal plane and perform a reverse teleportation ritual. there's a spell for this, but he hasn't been able to master is: *etherealness*. in this book {which he just got from his father's library}, written by the archmage Mordenkainen, is a ritual that replicated etherealness for up to 9 creatures, which must be done on a full moon - that's in 5 days - but requires the heartstone of a night hag {Areia at least knows a little bit about night hags, stories and such; also: covens, powerful spells, evil witches}. While exploring the EP, she has repeatedly seen a (description here - a night hag), in the border ethereal overlapping the barovian refugee camp. He's not sure what she wants from the refugees.

Q: wtf is border ethereal? V: explanation. Mirror allows her a clear view of the MP, elsewhere it's blurry and indistinct.

O: why send us to the tower? doesn't look like you need anything from there. V: definitely artifacts from the mage there, will help facing the hag(s). before sending you to certain death, I wanted to see if something in the tower might work instead.

A: what does the night hag do there? V: don't know, but she goes there often.

We discuss and decide to go to the tower before investigating that night hag. Then we leave.

Claudia hails as, passing on a message from Ireena: she went to the camp of her people.

We split the 100gp that Ireena gave us for taking her to Vallaki (25 gp each). #loot

Oliver and Areia get groceries and we head to the [Church of Saint Andral](../Places/Church%20of%20Saint%20Andral.md) for the night.

O&A get in just before the market closes, the remaining vegetables are kind of sad looking. Little meat, mostly wolf and some few elk or beef.

Back at the church, Oliver cooks.

Travel plans: the hag probably doesn't live in the refugee camp.

we chat a bit over food, and tell stories.

jasper's dabbled in stealing: when he left home, he took a large sum (which was earmarked for him, but not for simply taking).

We go to sleep, except for quiyra. She finishes her trance past midnight, when Ireena returns.

Quiyra summarizes the findings related to the investigation, Victor, the ghost, and the tower.

Quiyra also tells her about the genealogical tome. Ireena asks her to repeat, which she does. Ireena asks for details, but Quiyra doesn't have any.

Quiyra then spends a few hours as a cat wandering around, trying to get a feel for the city.

There is very little activity at this hour. People barricade themselves at night.

Not even the city gates have guards, except maybe one - they trust the sturdy gates. Only the Barovian refugee camp has lights and guards posted, they're by far the most active.
## Day 4
Quiyra lets the rest know that Ireena (who's still asleep) did make it back, very late though.
Also informs them that she told Ireena about the genealogy book, and how Ireena reacted.

We head toward the lake and Szoldar's hut. The gates are open and let us through. Soon enough ( ~15 min) we reach the lake; the path is earthy and uneven, full of pebbles and with some overgrown grass and moss. On the left are the svalich wood trees, on the right a chill breeze coming from the lake bringing a scent of damp earth. A raven croaks in the distance, the mud squelches under our feet, and waves lap agains the shores.

Not long after we smell something else: the musk of fur and the metallic tang of blood, along with the sound of rushing water. a small river from the lake rushing south, a small hut build near that. more of a weatherworn shack, really.

We approach and notice the door is ajar. Areia simply strides in. Oliver confirms that she is always like this.

The walls are quite stained with age. Upon them hang knives, traps, etc,well cleaned and oiled. Animal pelts hang from the rafters.

There are two men inside. One cleaning the blood from a rusted hunting trap, the other skinning a large wolf. The notice Areia instantly, smile, and greet her; they seem to have heard of us. They ask what we want: talk to Szoldar Szoldarovich.

The man cleaning the trap says that's him. We explain that we heard they know of a mage tower out there somewhere, which they confirm. They can take us there for 3gp, or just give us directions for drinks when we get back.

They're ready to go now-ish, just as soon as they finish getting their gear together.

They ask why we want to go there. Two reasons: artifacts, and it might be related to the disappeared young girl.

They're quite friendly and chatty, making small talk all the way. We learn the other man's name: Yevgeni. (Yevgeni Krushkin)

After ~Â½hour the path narrows and we come upon an old wooden bridge spanning the rushing river below. The river is bordered on either side by bushes and tree. Our boots echo against the old damp wood of the bridge.
To the north, we see the river flowing into the lake. To the south, the river proceeds and disappears into the mist.
Halfway across, we notice something odd: a small scrap of white material on a tree root on the opposite side of the river, to the south.
It's a handkerchief. Jasper sends his box to pick it up, after we cross the bridge.
It's embroidered with three letters: R.V.R. we remember that those for Rudolf van Richten.

Shortly after the bridge we encounter a4way intersection. Across it are four saplings, some leaning some upright,
Nearby is also a pair of scarecrows mounted on two separate trees, their eyes looking like they're almost mocking us. Poking from its guts are black raven feathers.
lower half of a wooden signpost sticking up at an angle, upper half in the weeds somewhere nearby.

Szoldar stops us. the saplings are new, and he has heard rumors of scarecrows moving. Quiyra suggests stealth, but Szoldar just draws his bow and looses upon one of the scarecrows. He hits, and it screams. He shoots again, but distracted by the horrifying scream, he misses.

Combat!
