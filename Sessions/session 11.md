## Day 4, cont.

we continute
arrive small mountain lake, trees, cliffs.
thick fog
trail leads into intersection: straight on, down toward lake.
path toward lake: decrepit old tower, collapsing scafoolds at the sides.
two riftwings statues, covered with moss, very weathered.
near base of tower, within sght of entrance: barrel-topped wagon spattered with mudl.

as soon as we arrive, Szoldar and Yevgeni leave us, since this was the deal and we can get back on our own.

around wagon: scent of sulfur, grass trampled by many feet (probably wolf paws). wagon very encrusted with mud, fresh coat of purple paint and fancy gold trim underneath. brass lantern at each corner, red draped cover tombstone-shaped windows, steel padlock in backdoor, cheap wooden signs: "keep out" "home and property of Ezmeralda d'Avenir" "trespass -> instantly incinerated"

we discuss what to do. Q knocks on the wagon, no response. verdict: she's not in, let's check out the tower.

Oliver walks up to the tower door; it's iron, no visible handles or hinges. large embossed blank red seal, carved into the lintel is a word: Khazan (sp?)

approach the door: 8 fist-sized buttons grow from the surface of the blank red seal. We recognize that the two symbols from Khazan's ring are among the symbols depicted by the buttons, and the positions match; the lines on the ring probably indicate how to join the buttons together.

Areia spots a second set of wheel marks.

Oliver translates the button, starting at the evocation symbol. They light up in sequence in colors associated with the schools of magic. Quiyra disses the "security system".

Jasper takes some time to ritually cast *detect magic*. The wagon has conjuration; the tower, abjuration.

We enter, Jasper first with his magic dtection. floor full of debris, old crates near one wall, torn curtain obscuring part of the vestibule.
hole with platform in the ground 4 pulleys + iron chains stretching up to a hole in the ceiling. next to the chains, 4 tall clay statues. clearly an elevator of some sort.
the statues are mundane.

Quiyra pokes and flicks one of the clay statues. Nothing happens.
We gingerly test the platform's weight-carrying. Nothing happens.
Finally, Quiyra steps on and tugs on the chains as if trying to lift herself. The clay statues animate pull the chains. We all go up one by one.

dust cobwebs rotten wood floor
some items are here:
beaded bracelet w/ wooden charms for a child, wrapped around silver dagger.
tarokka card (the hooded one)
two burnt pieces of parchment
no magic in any of them.

Areia inspects the dagger and bracelet, finds nothing of great interest, and pockets them.

parchments: part of a journal page, [Diary Entry from Khazan's Tower](../Diary%20Entry%20from%20Khazan's%20Tower.md); sketch for a sign: "Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders". The sketch is far more recent.

the tarokka card has been here a while, but is more recent than the tower damage.

Up we go again.

pretty empty floor. floor just as rotten as below. Hole in the wall connecting to the scaffolding. Scaffolding does have construction materials on it, was probably here to repair the walls.

And up one last time.

The top floor looks recently inhabited. Reeks of mold, but there are plenty of creature comforts: cozy bed, desk and chair, large iron stove with lotsa wood, light coming in through the windows, a suit of armor and a wooden chest. No magic.

We start poking around.
The suit of armor and chest emit a pleasant lavender aroma.
Oliver inspects the books.
Areia opens the chest. nothing interesting, just living supplies.
Looking out the window toward Lake Baratok, a patch of lily pads approximately fifteen feet from the shore stained a bright, flamboyant yellow, at clear odds with the muted greens of the lily pads nearby.

scrolls on the desk: mostly burnt, remains of scrolls. previously, notes on various supernatural creatures (vampires, werewolves, etc)

areia pokes at the armor. looking inside are markings indicating it's probably animated.

Quiyra inspects the fireplace and finds flakes of paper inside, with remnants of writing on them. She puts a log in it and lights it, to see if something happens.

Oliver checks the chest for false bottoms or the like. Nope.

Quiyra pats down the bed and sniffs it. It's been used recently. The sheets aren't properly fitted, and there's a faint impression of a body - adult human sized.

There is no basement, so we have now explored the whole tower.

Jasper shakes the armor gently. It rattles at him.

It seems someone got here first. We decide to leave and inspect the other clues.

Lilypads first. Below the water level are three ceramic pots, two of them have yellow paint along the rims - the source of the stain. Quiyra uses shape water to pull them out, and Areia picks them up from there. They're quite heavy, and all closed.

We start opening them one by one.
Pot 1: full of rocks.
the others: also rocks.
........ what?????
however: the shade of yellow is reminiscent of Rictavio's attire.
Quiyra shapes a wave to drag the pots back into the lake. Areia starts ranting about the absurdity of the rocks.

We go follow the wheel tracks.
There are two sets: the one made by Ez's wagon, and one made by some other wagon.
We decide to go after the second track. As we walk, Olvier asks Areia for the silver dagger and she easily gives it up.
Quiyra understands that this set of tracks is approximately 5 days old. They take us a little deeper into the woods, something we've been wary of until now.
We find a small sheltered clearing, where someone made camp. Much of the ground here is stained with yellow paint. The wheel track dead-ends here.

Jasper investigates the camp, it's around 5 days old. Quiyra casts *detect magic*, there is nothing here. However, she remembers that Ezmeralda's wagon had a conjuration aura; maybe there is some magic that conjures/dismisses/teleports wagons?

We return to the tower. Jasper sends the box to poke at the padlock on the door, nothing happens. Oliver goes up and starts trying to pick the padlock, but Areia dissuades him and tries first in case it explodes. However, Oliver simply stands next to her so he can be sure to also get exploded.

Both retreat to a safe(r) distance and Jasper sends the box to open the door. It does so. A big cluster of potions all fall on the wagon floor, causing a giant fiery explosion. Only Quiyra is far enough to be outside the blast radius; everyone else manages to avoid at most of the damage, at least. The box gets proper exploded.

Quiyra brings a 5 ft cube of lakewater to quench the fire. We start looking through the debris. There's nothing there.

Time of day: around lunchtime. We take a break, rest up and such. Quiyra distributes some goodberries.

We follow the Ezmeralda's wagon's tracks for a bit and find them joining up with the Old Svalich road, heading toward Vallaki. At the crossroads from earlier, we hear a deep voice call: "who goes there!?"

shaggy black hair, thick mutton chops, gray cloak, leaning on spear, small bundle of animal pelts on shoulder. behind him: grim-faced woman with long dark hair loosely braided, also has a spear, also wears a cloak.

q: just travelers. you?

Szold and Matilda, trappers from Krest. We also introduce ourselves, and explain that we're heading to Vallaki. So are they. Trvel together? sure.
They heard the explosion

Tales: a Vistana woman, phantomlike, who stalks the paths under the moon's gaze, not of this world but of the realms of the dead. She's said to be a frightful sight, eyes like embers in the dark, clad in a patchwork of cloaks like a vagabond, but despite her appearance, she carries a wicked blade. She's been butchering good folks in the woods, they say - heads trophies for the darker side.

The trappers try to downplay the danger of this tale, but we are having none of it. They ask if we have good steel to defend ourselves, and we take the opportunity to show off.

"However, it seems you've forgotten something... silver."

He turns werewolf and lunges at Quiyra. silvery barbs! all miss.
