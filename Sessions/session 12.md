## Day 4 , cont²
Rest of our travel to Vallaki is safe.

On the way, we visit the Vistani camp again, to ask about the bracelet we found in Khazan's tower.

We find Arrigal (Arabell's uncle) easily enough. Oliver explains that we found some possible leads and Areia shows him the wooden bracelet. He takes it and examines it, then declares he's bringing it to Luvash. He goes to the big tent in the center, and we follow him.

Luvash is there, sitting and drinking. Arrigal hands him the bracelet and he examines it as well. He confirms it's Arabell's, and asks where we found it: the tower. He asks if we have any other clues.

We mention the dagger found with it, and Ezmeralda d'Avenir's wagon. Luvash tells Arrigal to dispatch a scout squad for Ez. Oliver also shows Luvash the Rictavio pamphlet.

We return to Vallaki, where we go to speak to Victor. The servants are a little alarmed at our appearance, but Victor calms them and leads us to his study again. We inform him that the tower was a bust, he gives us a blank stare, and we leave again.

We go to the Bluewater Inn first, since it's closer. It's actually quite crowded. The innkeeper's recognize us and ask what they can get us; we decide to eat, since it's about that time anyway. We get our food (bowls of stew, and water to drink) after a few minutes. It's loud and crowded, hard to make out any details except that people seem to be anticipating the Blazing Sun festival. As we get our food, Quiyra asks after Ireena and Rictavio.

Ireena not seen, Rictavio just left to inspect his wagon (which is in the R6? stockyard). She warns us of !!dangerous beasts!!, there are rumors that the ringmaster keeps something big and deadly in his wagon. He left not long ago and might return soon.

After a while, Szoldar and Yevgeni enter; they give us a nod of recognition.

We finish our stew, and go to the stockyard. It's quite large, looking like a hybrid of a shop and a warehouse, with a long line of stocks and stables near it. We see one wagon much more flamboyant and colorful than the others, with Rictavio kneeling by it working on the wheels. Quiyra notices that he seems to be adjusting the same spoke over and over, while moving his lips - a cover?

Quiyra walks up behind him, intending to startle him, but he seems to have noticed her approach and is unfazed by her sudden hello. He remembers us, if vaguely, and asks what we're looking for.

We show him the pamphlet, explaining that we found it in a tower a ways away. He seems honestly surprised by this, and explains how he distributed the pamphlets: mostly they're just laid at the front of his wagon.

A: Where does he get his paint? usually this stockyard, but he's been traveling a lot, so: here and there. Which color were we interested in? The yellow - it's from Krez. The red, from a band of traveling Vistani (delightful people!). The blue, he doesn't remember.

O: y'see, the reason for the weird questions is, there's this missing child. {describes Arabella}. Rictavio says that while he sees a lot of children (they enjoy his show!) he doesn't usually remember their faces, and in any case if she's a Vistani child (i.e. barred from Vallaki) she wouldn't have been able to attend it.

Areia asks after the "dangerous beast" that he is rumored to have. He reaches inside his jacket and dramatically reveals a sockpuppet of a tiger. We (jokingly) inspect it. He confesses that the rumors of him handling dangerous beasts are mostly from his (embellished) stories, and that while he does deal with dangerous beasts he's not reckless enough to endanger his audience with them.

Finally, Quiyra asks who he was talking to. He affects confusion, but she points out what she spotted when we arrived. Oliver however decides not to press it so we can shadow him more subtly. We take our leave, and Oliver explains as much. Quiyra agrees and summons a raven to spy on Rictavio.

Rictavio just stands there for a while, then returns to "fixing his wheel" and doing whatever - humming the words of a song for a bit, then stopping and speaking softly, as we suspected. "Do you need anything? I am gong to the ?? so if you want something in particular I can get it maybe. They only serve wolf steak and stew here." A young voice answers. "I will be fine with the stew, thank you. I'll be waiting for your return. I heard that you were talking to some people?" R - "yeah, they are outsiders I met the other day. They seemed quite inquisitive, I think they suspect something. I will think of our next course of action. I'll keep you safe." "ok" "good girl. see you later".

why tae fuck does this man have a child in a box

child is a young girl and is in the wagon. Vistani accent.

After quickly chatting about whether to have the raven get the girl's attention (no need), Quiyra sends the raven to watch for Rictavio. He is on his way toward the inn.

We walk up to the cart. Oliver knocks gently and says hello; asks if she is Arabell (yes). O: your family's worried sick about you. Ab: I know. O: how'd you get in here? Ab: this is a plan we discussed togrther. He wants to keep me safe from the Devil. O: Is the Devil after you? Ab: I was kidnapped by one of his spies, Rictavio saved me and protected me. She seems quite calm, not scared at all, as if expecting this.

She asks for Rictavio to be included in the discussion. He doesn't trust us, but she does: she had a vision that someone would follow her trail, us. That's why she left clues: the ring, handkerchief, tarokka card, and bracelet. She asks if we found them all; we did.

As we muse on whether to call Rictavio back, the raven signals that he's returning anyway. Soon we see him too, running with cane in hand - clearly ready for a fight. He's almost whispering, asks if we're spies of the Devil. We deny vehemently; we were sent by her family, in fact. Arabell confirms that we mean her no harm, and asks that he open the door.

He relaxes, and opens the door. We see a small child sitting inside, matching the description of Arabell: a small Vistani child with black hair and the usual Vistani garb, holding on to a toy sabertooth tiger. She smiles at us and thanks us for the efforts, as well as Rictavio. She's sorry for the injuries we suffered, but we deflect that.

Rictavio begins the explanation. That tower is his hideaway base, where he goes to lay low. He saw a vistani man bring sack to golden-haired vampire spawn, Escher, on the banks of Luma river. He attacked them, killing the vistana and scarring the vampire (who fled). Upon opening the sack, Arabell was inside. He "interrogated" the Vistana's head: Strahd issued a bounty on young girls matching her description. They both agreed that taking her back to the Vistani camp would expose her to Strahd, too dangerous. They returned to the tower, stayed there awhile. He then disguised himself as the dead Vistani, snuck into camp to steal some horses and a wagon. The tower is protected against divinations, but he believes the Devil is well aware of that and so they decided to flee from there since that would be one of the first places the Devil would look. He also gave her an amulet that protects from location-discerning magic.

During the conversation, Quiyra hears someone approaching. Looking through the raven, it's Arrigal climbing into the stables. Rictavio gets ready, hand on his cane. Arrigal declares, "fascinating story, Rictavio," and thanks us. "Come on Arabell, let's go home." Rictavio draws himself up, denies Arrigal, and names him spy. Arrigal's hands go to his weapons, and Rictavio draws a sword from his cane.

Before violence erupts, Arabell yells out "please, stop!", looking at us with desperate eyes.

Quiyra quickly steps out and declares to Arrigal, "Arabell believes she is in danger and going with you will endanger her further."

Arg: where proof? Rictavio opens a box, inside the severed head of a vistana.
Q: and surely Arabell can corroborate? She nods.
Ric takes out another talisman, animating the head to speak once more.
Ric, solemnly: What is your name? - Jan.
What lord did you serve in life? The vampire, Strahd von Zarovich.
Did that lord command you to kidnap Arabell? He did, through his servant the vampire Escher.
What did he order? He bade me bring her to the Luma river, whence she would be brought to Castle Barovia.
And how did you die? Decapitation by sword.
Oliver corroborates that this is a real working spell and doesn't lead to lies.
Arabell also confirms.

Arg: seems we are at an impasse.
Oliver: nah. we'll all stay here, get some rest, maybe visit the camp.
Discussion: Rictavio: she should stay with him, Arg: she should be with her family. Both concerned with her safety, but disagree on the best way.
Idea: in the church? but, vistani not allowed in Vallaki, can't hide in there, and burgomaster probably won't respect the holy ground.
Arg: offer deal: relocate your wagon inside our camp. we will welcome you as one of our own. She can stay under your roof as well as be with her family.
Jasper: Madam Eva could protect?
Quiyra: she probably doesn't have the power for that, directly. She sent us.
Rictavio asks us what we think of Arrigal's proposal. We think it's good. They shake on it.
Arabell moves toward Quiyra, grabs her arms, and thanks her. Quiyra corrects her: don't just thank me. She nods, and thanks the rest of us; addressing Rictavio as van Richten in the process and calling him a good man. She also says she thinks his son agrees, which leaves him flabbergasted. She explains: vR's son is keeping her safe, and him. Rictavio collapses to his knees, becoming a weary old man more than anything else. Soon the moment breaks, as Arabell's eyes roll back and she goes rigid.

Ab, echoing voice with far older woman:
> In darkest night, the light shall flee,
> No dawn to break, with no reprieve.
> From the grave, the dead shall climb,
> Their restless march a baleful sign.
> At castle’s peak, a heart beats red,
> Its hunger deep and ever-fed.
> Should silence fall, the skies shall crack,
> A thousand souls in torment black.

She instantly falls unconscious.
