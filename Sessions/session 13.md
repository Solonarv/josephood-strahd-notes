## Day 4, cont³

Van Richten and Arrigal are both concerned over Arabell's unconsciousness, though Arrigal seems calmer.
Oliver checks her for a fever; no, just asleep.
Q: has this happened before? van Richten shakes his head, Arrigal says yes sometimes - she has Madam Eva's gift.
O: has Arabell said anything like this before? van Richten takes off his amulet and throws it at Oliver as a token of thanks. It's a magical talisman. van Richten explains: this casts speak with dead, or gentle repose.
Arrigal invites us to the Vistani camp for the night, and we accept. He promises a reward for us, as well.
We all head out to the Vistani camp on Rictavio's wagon. As we ride, Arabell wakes up somewhat confused and apologizes for falling asleep; Quiyra explains that she uttered a prophecy and repeats the words again.

Arrigal shouts out the happy news to the camp as we arrive. Once stopped, Arabell rushes off into Luvash's arms.

Arrigal invites us along to choose a reward. Says there is one item in particular that we might enjoy. Oliver stays behind to watch the Arabell's happy reunion for a bit; Arrigal leads the rest of us toward one of the wagons in the central circle and opens it with a key. "Pick one!", he says:
wooden chest: 1200 electrum pieces, strahd-faced (≃ 600 gp)
iron chest: 650 gp
jewellery box: 6 pieces of jewellery, a potion in a crystal vial (potion of poison, looks like healing though)
wooden throne: inlaid with gold and gemstones.
rug: quite extraordinary, unicorn motif.
small wooden box w/12 vials of liquid (fake potions for selling, as a scam - Arrigal grins as he explains this)

we pretty much unanimously decide on the iron chest with 650 gp. proposed split: 75 gp each, 300 gp set aside for a revivify diamond, 50 gp unaccounted for.

We join the revelries for a while. Arabell sticks to Luvash's side the whole evening, and is very happy about the bunny we got her - reminding us that despite the maturity she displayed earlier she is still a child.

After the revelries, we split the gold: 162 gp each, 2 extra for Areia.
## Day 5
In the morning, Oliver passes out some celery (treats from chef feat). quiyra, oliver, and areia partake.

the plan for today: look for the hag. we need her heartstone. wtf is that? Jasper remembers: it's a focus for the hag's innate powers. always a glossy black gem, which the hag must craft. while she has it, she can use it to become ethereal. also, legends say just touching a heartstone can cure any disease.

Quiyra has managed to remember that night hags haunt dreams.

We enter Vallaki again, and head to the church looking for Ireena. There are quite a few people here, awaiting the morning ceremony. Father Lucien (sp?) nods to us, but we don't find Ireena upstairs. The bed also hasn't been used recently. We also remember that we haven't seen her since the small hours of [session 10](session%2010.md#Day 4).

We head to the Barovian refugee camp, which is a ramshackle assemblage of tents huddled against the city wall surrounded by a crude wooden barricade. The refugees are clearly not doing well, cold and hungry.

Soon after we enter, an old man and a younger woman approach us. The man welcomes us, asks if we're from the city; we say no, they seem disappointed. He's Emeric, she's Magda. We return their greetings and introduce ourselves.

Oliver asks after Ireena, and after a hag. Emeric says Ireena is probably around somewhere, though people are quite cold toward her - some blame her as well as her brother for failing to protect them from Strahd, while others remember a superstition that red-haired Barovian women are bad luck. Few appreciate her presence, but she tries.

Quiyra asks him about strange dreams. Emeric says one has been suffering a recurring nightmare the past two nights: Franz. He also has some strange wasting disease, and his mind is filled with nightmares. He recently lost his children, and is still grieving and disturbed. Quiyra shares her suspicion that there is something supernatural happening here.

small lonely tent at end of camp. inside, three stained pallets: two child-sized, an old patched stuffed rabbit lays across one. young woman kneeling in the mud beside the full-size pallet, clutching a bundle of herbs and holding a damp cloth the forehead of the man on the pallet.
pale and drenched in sweat, face illuminated by just a single candle. his face etched with exhaustion. it takes a moment for us to notice he's scarcely above 30. Ireena is also here; she smiles weakly at us.
As we enter, the man starts wheezing with laughter, spouting half-sentences: are we demons sent from the mother night? come to drag his soul into the mist? the young woman apologizes on his behalf, says he's been delirious.
She asks if we're here to help. We say we will try, but are unsure of our chances of success.
The woman tells us: two nights ago, nightmares started and he fell sick. she couldn't do much, just wishes she could do something.
A: what's in the dreams?
She looks at Franz, and says: some weird nightmare. he is strapped to a millstone, on his chest a female figure sitting, with gray-blue skin, deep eyes, small ram horns, and sharp yellow teeth. she s holding a black stone against his forehead and whispering of damnation. in the background he hears the cries of his two children, high-pitched cackles, and a windmill grinding.

We remember the windmill a ways outside town, and speculate that we may need to go there

Franz asks the woman, Ireena, and our guides to leave him alone with us. They oblige, though the woman seems reluctant. Once they're gone he begins sobbing: there is more to the story. you see, 3 months ago, my wife died of illness. i joined these people with my two children, theodore and myrtle; I wanted to keep them safe from strahd's servants. a few weeks after arriving here, i bought some pastries from a peddler they had the magical powers to let him dream of his wife, returned to his arms like she never died at all. i started buying them regularly, i became addicted; spent hours then days in those dreams, then my savings ran out and the old woman refused to sell me more unless i paid a terrible price. three nights ago, i led my children past the edge of the woods, and she took them in exchange for as many pastries as I wanted. I couldn't believe what I was doing; I tried to take my children back, but she refused saying the deal we made was final. When I attempted to take back my children by force, she just put me to sleep, and when I woke up, my children were nowhere to be found. I passed out again, from exhaustion, and then was brought back here. I have been having terrible nightmares every single night since. Please, take my children. I have been cursed by the gods. I deserve death, but my children don't deserve the suffering I've put them through. I can't pay you.

Franz could feel the heart of the windmill - three black hearts beating as one, the gnarled arm holding the key. He then cries himself to sleep.

We scatter around town to attend to errands:
- Jasper and Areia go ask Victor about hags
- Quiyra and Oliver go shopping for armor, which they find without much trouble. Oliver buys studded leather and Quiyra buys scale mail.

Jasper and Areia find Victor easily, he says he was about to call them. He has a plan, two ways to get a heartstone from a hag: willingly, or by force. Willingly requires a bargain, exchanging something of great value; and hags are legendary dealmakers, and can be trusted to stick to the letter of their words - but only the letter! by force requires incapacitating or killing the hag, but this is quite hard. first, they form covens of three, which makes them stronger as well as providing allies. He's unsure whether this one has any sisters or daughters. Also, night hags can use their heartstones to flee into the ethereal, something which is nearly impossible to counter. You can stop it only by sealing her into a binding circle before initiating hostilities. Also, I advise silvered weapons to bypass their demonic resilience. Victor confirms that magic weapons would also work, but he doesn't have one. No one will sell you a silvered weapon here, but I can get you one: spear or pike. Areia asks for the pike; Victor scrawls a sealed writ letting Areia requisition one from the barracks.

Jasper reports the speculation that the hag is operating from the windmill, and that one or more of the hags is selling addictive pastries and taking children. Victor recalls reading about a windmill and goes to fetch the book. He returns shortly with a big book, and opens it to the page describing the windmill. It was assigned to the Durst family. The sign has a compartment build into it, likely a storage place; if the hag is hiding something other than her heartstone, it would likely be there.

Jasper also asks Victor to elaborate on the binding circle he mentioned. Unfortunately Victor doesn't know how to perform the ritual, he merely has an illustration of the binding circle, and has had no luck so far in making one. As he speaks, Stella's spirit gestures excitedly in the mirror, some kind of hand sign. Victor's eyes widen and his face pales: no! you can't be serious! absolutely not!
they descend into an argument. eventually he just ignores her; he explains, though that Stella claims to have seen a binding circle while exploring the ethereal, on a much larger scale: a circle surrounding the Wachter house, preventing her from entering. This prevented her from contacting her mother. She says her mother, Lady Wachter, might know how to create such a binding circle, and suggests asking the Lady for help. However the woman is cautious and skeptical, especially where the Vallakovichs are concerned. If she doesn't believe her story you will have to ask her to momentarily disable the circle so Stella can show herself.

Areia goes to pick up her silvered pike from the guards and the party reunites to discuss the information Victor and Stella gave. Areia uses the time waiting for Oliver and Quiyra's return to attune to her new pike.

We decide to pay a visit to the Wachterhaus and maybe get some help with a binding circle. Then we will go to the windmill, where we will (hopefully) kill the hags, take a heartstone, and rescue the kids.

Areia has an idea.
