## Day 5, cont
Areia proposes:
we do the circle thing (which Areia can't help with). In the meantime, Areia keeps the hags busy by going in and negotiating a deal with them (but delaying enough that we finish the circle first). Also she'll be right there and can bite them.

We reach the Wachterhaus.
thick garden, many herbs and vines. slouching roof over two stories. handsomely painted red door, frosted glass in the upper half. gate slightly ajar. Areia boldly strides up to it and pushes it open.

We follow her and Oliver knocks on the door. Some people move inside in reaction, and soon a (probably-)servant is peering through the frosted glass at us. He then cracks open the door, and asks what we want. Oliver: talk to Lady Wachter. Servant: you need an appointment. Oliver: we're here on behalf of Stella. At the servant's confusion, Oliver insists, and the servant leads us into a sitting room, where he asks us to wait.

After 5 minutes or so, an elegant older woman in a long red dress arrives. probably around 60, 70. very sharp features, gaunt cheeks, severe hairstyle with gray hair all slicked back and tied in a tight bun.
She bids us welcome, asks our names and purpose. We introduce ourselves.
Oliver explains that Lady Wachter's daughter is in a very strange situation and has need of a binding circle, similar to the one around this house.
Lady is suspicious, asks what we know about her daughter.
Oliver: little, but we know she's currently in the company of a Victor.
Lady: any proof?
Areia describes Stella, points out that we've only been here for a few days.
this does seem to surprise the Lady. claims that this is a cruel joke on her and her family.
Jasper jumps in, explains that Stella was experimenting with magic and got stuck. She and Victor have been working to fix this. Stella has been trying to get in touch with Lady Wachter, but couldn't because of the binding circle around this property.
Lady Wachter proposes that she take down the binding circle, allowing Stella to manifest and confirm the story. Jasper goes off to the Burgomaster's house to arrange this with Victor and Stella, but it turns out Stella was already waiting.
Meanwhile, the servant offers us tea and Lady Wachter returns with a miniature model of the house. When Jasper returns and reports, she murmurs an incantation; there are some magical glowing lights, and she informs us that the circle has been dispelled.
Just a few moments later, we see a peony levitate and deposit itself in Lady Wachter's lap. She gasps in disbelief, dropping her teacup to the floor, where it shatters. She's overcome with emotion, explains peonies were always Stella's favorite flower.
The teacup shards on the floor move, forming the shape of a crescent moon. This moves her greatly, and she begins calling out Stella's name. After a few moments, she calms herself and asks: assuming we're not playing a trick on her, what do we need from her?
Oliver explains: our one way of helping involves fighting some hags, but they can simply escape into the ethereal. From her, we need a binding circle to stop them from doing this.
She asks after size. Quiyra explains: windmill sized.
Lady Wachter will need help from some associates.
Lady Wachter explains, there are two ways for such a circle to work: keep things out, or keep them in. keeping in requires knowing the true names of the targets. if even one escapes, they could attack and bring the whole circle crashing down.
It seems we have no easy avenues to learn their true names. Lady Wachter says she can arrange the circle we need once we have all the information.

We take our leave, with Lady Wachter's well-wishes.

We think of the following avenues to find out the hags' true names: ask Rictavio, ask Victor / his library.

So we head out to the Vistani camp. It seems to have settled down a bit from the confusion. We go right up to Rictavio's cart and find him there, making adjustments to it for real this time. Oliver hails him; he nods in greeting, but doesn't stop his work.
Rictavio says things seem fine, for now. He'll stay for a few more days, and then move on.
We explain the situation: need to kill some hags, can he help with finding out their true names?
He gets up from his work, thinking. Says he's not the biggest hag expert, but says their deals involve physical contracts, signed with each hag's true name.
Usually the hags keep these contracts near the heart of their lair. So we can try to sneak in, or we can try to make a deal.
Areia asks: what do hags usually ask for, in their deals?
Rictavio doesn't know; it varies. He demurs (again), saying he knows more about lycanthropy and undeath than about hags.
Rictavio showed us a book about hags when he was explaining all this to us.
He's told us all he knows, so we head to the Burgomaster's mansion again to visit its library. We're starting to draw weird looks for going in and out of the mansion so much.

In the library, we also find Victor. We explain that Lady Wachter did agree to help, but we need the hags' true names for it to work. Victor makes the same suggestions that Rictavio did, but we also remember that Franz might know them.
Victor suggests making a deal to borrow the heartstone. We say that we already had a similar idea; could we back out of a deal at the last moment? yes, but the hag might become violent, and anyway the hags always sign last and make no copies of the contract.
However we had not thought of simply asking to borrow the heartstone. We would also learn their true names in the process, so we could kill them afterwards.
Victor informs us that since it's the coven that allows deals to be made, any deal-contract would have all three of the hags' names on it.
Quiyra leaves the others to brainstorm and goes to visit Franz, to check if he remembers anything. He had no written contract, and knows only one name: Morgantha. She leaves him with shame and a weak home.
Brainstorming results: many thoughts
Quiyra returns and we recognize Morgantha's name. We have some concerns over having eaten her pies, but hopefully our previous friendly interactions with Morgantha will buy us some leeway to talk.
Quiyra sneaking about is brought up, but it's risky.
Quiyra suggests: try to make a deal; if we can't or won't pay, we can always try the other options later.
Deal: we borrow the heartstone. When we visit them to return it, we kill them. Contract clause: we have to return the heartstone ourselves, but they can extract additional penalties. Idea: we ask to borrow the heartstone for 2 days or whatever, and just return it early.
How long will the ritual take? Victor has no idea.
Should Victor come with us to make the deal? after some discussion, the consensus is no:
- he doesn't need to be there
- hiding him could be an asset
- he needs to spend time on research
After some confusion, Victor agrees that we can make some light assumptions regarding his contribution (e.g. books he has that we don't).

We leave for the windmill, after not finding any pie-slinging old ladies in the Barovian camp.

It's shrouded in mist, very old and somewhat decrepit, but still working. There is a smell of burning wood, and the heat coming from the windmill cuts the chill of the wind and mist. We stride openly up to the door, and Jasper knocks on it.
A while later, the door opens: it's Morgantha. She's glad we decided to visit, and asks if we're here to buy more pies. She invites us in, and we enter.
Inside is a somewhat ramshackle and not very clean kitchen; baskets and dishware piled everywhere, her carts inside this room, chickens clucking in their coop
heavy wooden trunk, wooden cabinet.
Q: heard rumor that you live with others. is this true?
M: yes, they live upstairs. Hope you heard good things?
Q: eh, didn't hear much at all
O: someone in trouble, we need your help
M: oh?
O: yes, by any chance do you have a heartstone around?
M smiles wickedly. yes! I have one. but it is very precious to me.
O: of course, I understand. That is why I merely wish to borrow it - until after the next full moon?
M: I can let you borrow it, of course; but in return I must ask you to perform a task for me.
A: what is the task?
M: I need a soul leech. You must deliver it to the office of Strahd's chamberlain Rahadin. Upon arriving in his office, just uncork the phial I will give you, and that's it.
Q: as you know, interfering with the Devil can be dangerous. Might I ask why you're interfering with him?
M: refuses, better to keep our respective secrets.
We agree that this seems doable.
M: To ensure your compliance, I wish to take your dreams momentarily. If you fail to accomplish the task within 14 days, or betray me, I will keep them.
Q: I don't wish to cheat you, so I must inform you - I don't dream.
M: ah, but your friends do.
O: where is the chamberlain's office?
M: inside castle ravenloft.
We all agree that this seems hard, though probably doable within 14 days.
O: just in case, anything else you want done?
she extends her gnarled hand. If you wish to make a deal, I can make it happen.
She starts writing up the deal:
- we get possession of her heartstone for 3 days (until the day after the full moon night). We can return it however we want, so long as they have it back; we can assume one of the hags will be at the windmill to receive it.
- we get the phial with the soul leech, which we must spill onto the chamberlain's desk.
- She takes our dreams (not Quiyra's). They'll be returned when we complete the soul leech task.
Jasper signs. Oliver hesitates a moment:
After a brief discussion with Oliver, Morgantha calls down her daughters. They're old women, dressed in baking-appropriate ways, and look friendly.
We sign, in order: Jasper, Oliver, Areia (in all caps, big letters spaced far apart), Quiyra Shelra (in elvish), Morgantha Stormreaver, Belladonna Sunbane, Offalia Wormwiggle. The hags write their names in abyssal, which Areia and Oliver can sort of parse since they know infernal which uses the same script.

After we all sign, Morgantha extends her hand toward Offalia, who hands over a phial containing a leech-like creature - though its flesh is ghostly white and translucent, with purplish blue veins, as well as a black onyx-like stone which fits the description of a heartstone.
Thus the deal is done, and it remains for us to do our parts in it. We say our goodbyes and leave.
On the way back, we chitchat about making deals; Quiyra comments that this was rather different from dealing with fey, though she hasn't done this herself.

We return to Vallaki; by the time we arrive, it's about dinnertime. We go see Victor, who's currently dining alone, but stops to meet with us. We report that we went to the windmill and made a deal with the hags. Oliver puts the heartstone on the table. He swears.
Quiyra warns him: it is borrowed. do not destroy it, do not lose it.
Victor says he needs a leyline for the ritual. He found one beneath Vallaki, somewhere beneath the Wachterhaus.
We agree that she'll probably agree to let him use it.
Since it'd be uncouth to interrupt Lady Wachter's dinner anyway, Victor invites us to join him for his dinner, which is wonderful - the best meal we've had since arriving in Barovia.
Victor suggests contacting Lady Wachter tomorrow morning. He also offers us rooms for the night, which we accept, so he instructs the staff to make it happen.
We have (mostly) restful nights. Quiyra uses the extra time afforded by trancing to stew in her thoughts some more.
