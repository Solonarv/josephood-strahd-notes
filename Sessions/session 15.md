## Day 6
We wake up after a restful night at the Vallakovich mansion, quite early.

We ponder what to do in the next few days. Victor doesn't show for breakfast, at all. There is no response to a knock on the door, and Quiyra is positive the room is empty (elf ears win again). The door isn't locked, and the room is indeed empty. The bed's state indicates he didn't sleep here all night.

We check his study, and find him there, passed out surrounded by books and papers in front of the mirror. The book on his face is a book on the Ethereal and night hags by Mordenkainen, the same one he showed us before. We also spot Stella crouched in the mirror opposite Victor, moving as if caressing Victor's hair

Quiyra waves hello to Stella and asks whether we should wake him; she shakes her head no, so we leave again. We leave Victor a note reminding him to talk to Lady Wachter about accessing the leyline beneath her house, and informing him that we went to the Vistani camp.

There, we find Rictavio tidying away some of his stuff, possibly packing or getting ready to do so.

At Areia's question, he says he's not leaving now, but soon probably; the girl is probably safe here. He asks how our mission went, and Quiyra tells him about the deal and task.
Rictavio opines that this is a very difficult task, since not just anyone can get into Castle Ravenloft.

Rictavio hasn't met Rahadin personally, but has met one of his consorts recently. Rahadin is a vampire, or possibly a spawn like Lady S??s. Rahadin also serves as Strahd's herald: Strahd doesn't move much from Castle Ravenloft, so when he has something to announce, Rahadin delivers the message.

Quiyra asks if Areia's joking suggestion that Strahd would just  Strahd has lived for long. One thing vampires crave is entertainment, so he probably took a liking to us, since to him we are something like puppies entering his domain. Mindset: in Strahd's eyes, we are no more than insects or puppies, interesting but harmless. He won't care what we do. One trait all vampires share is arrogance, and the ruler of a Domain of Dread in particular.

Quiyra seizes on his wording: Domain of Dread? are there more? R: yes, he's writing a book on them actually.

We decide to ask him about the [Fortunes](../Fortunes.md).

1st card: could refer to any of the three towns of Barovia: Barovia, Vallaki, or ?Krezk?. It's probably Vallaki though. House of corruption isn't the church, no brothels there either. Maybe the inn? Unclear. If it's a noble house (as Areia suggests), probably either the Wachterhaus or the Vallakovich mansion. Quiyra: could the ghosts be non-literal? an echo of the past, or something? R: an old weapon, a suit of armor, a portrait? an old cupboard? A child wearing a sheet as a ghost disguise??

2nd card: Rictavio recalls the area around Krezk having wolf issues. Near Krezk is Lake Baratok, so probably there. Mother Night is a goddess that Barovians worship; the counterpart of the morning lord. She represents night and what is evil. She is close/similar to Shar.

3rd card: Rictavio overheard someone here speak about traveling toward something to do with amber; one of the dusk elves.

4th card: the Abbey is in Krezk. Rictavio: the text worries me a bit; maybe I am overthinking, but I used to have a Vistana pupil, but she did not come with me when I entered Barovia. Areia asks after the pupil's name: Ezmeralda. Quiyra asks if she has a predilection for explosive alchemy; at Rictavio's puzzlement, she relates our encounter with Ezmeralda's immediately intruder incinerating wagon.

5th card: beating heart of the castle, probably the main hall?

questions about the personal readings:
- who/what is corpse star? he doesn't know.
- who/what/where is reaper's shadow? he doesn't know either.

He and Quiyra bemoan the lack of maps of this place. There are too many dangers now, and those with the requisite knowledge from when these lands were kinder are probably all dead now. Rictavio speculates that the first card - "knowledge of the ancients" - might lead to a map, though.

Q: how far away is Krezk? Just 2 hours. Quiyra expresses astonishment at how short it is; Rictavio remarks that Barovia is not that big, which is no surprise since it takes a lot of power to fold over a demiplane. As a result, we decide that we'll visit Krezk today and/or tomorrow.

We say our goodbyes to Rictavio and go talk to the dusk elves. Inside we find Casimir again, and some puzzled looks. They ask what brings us here. Quiyra mentions the "pile of treasure beyond a set of amber doors" and "the place where amber giants sleep"; he immediately knows what place those are referring to: The highest peaks of Barovia, inside Mount Ghakis. There's a very ancient temple, which has a set of amber doors. He can show us the road, but only on the promise that we bring him with us. It's 1 day of travel away. We have no objections to this, but clarify that we're not leaving anytime soon. We say our farewells.

We head off toward Krezk, but not before Quiyra sends a raven familiar to deliver notes to Victor and Ireena letting them know that we're going out of town.

Krezk in the same direction as the Vistani camp. The road comes to an X intersection, with branches to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The lower half of a snapped wooden signpost thrusts upward at an angle near the eastern elbow of the intersection. The top half of the sign, featuring arms pointing in four directions, lies in the weeds nearby. However, it's easy enough to figure out how the broken-off halves of the pole fit together.
SE: Krezk, Tsolenka pass.
NW: Lake Baratok
NE: Vallaki, Ravenloft (the direction we came from)
SE: Berez

We continue, and reach another intersection; this one is unlabeled. The main road keeps going, and a dirt path branches off toward a craggy mountain spur. The earth of the path is hard-packed, a different color: a pallid grey brown, reminiscent of cold ashes. The trees too are a different color, a faded green rather than the rich green of the other forests around here. The path eventually vanishes into the woods. We guess that this side path goes to Tsolenka pass, and continue along the main road.

Thus we reach yet another intersection. There is a weatherworn signpost with three arms.
N: Krezk; stone bridge
E: Vallaki; where we came from, sloping gently up
SW: The Wizard of Wines, sloping gently down

On the bridge we see a figure clad in rusting armor, clutching a gleaming longsword in its pale hands. Quite similar to the other undead knight we met. We head in that direction with no qualms. The knight 
burgomaster of Krezk, Baron Dmitri Krezkov, has grown weary of outside world, and few things have passed between Krezk's gates in recent weeks. However, the Krezkov line has long been honorable, so we may be able to persuade him to lend hospitality. We thank him for the information, and he lets us pass with a small bow.
be wary: there is a werewolf pack from the mounts, that has expanded its territory recently.

road continues north, climbs a rocky escarpment, ends at gatehouse in 20ft high stone wall with buttresses every 50ft or so. encloses a settlement on the side of snowdusted mountain spur. beyond the wall, snowy pines and roofs. somber tones of a bell from the abbey high above the settlement. the chime is inviting, a welcome change from the oppressive silence and fogs. seems to be a switchback road climbing up from the walls to the abbey. air grows colder as we approach, two square towers flank a stone archway with "krezk" carved in, and a big door.
four figures (guards) clutch spears and watch us nervously.

We approach the guards, who forbid us entry. We ask why - "strangers bring trouble". Oliver asks for simple hospitality and shelter from the dangerous roads. At this point, we hear footsteps inside the gatehouse, and soon a short man appears above the parapet. He's stoutly built, and panting from his run up the stairs. He introduces himself as Baron Dmitri Krezkov, and welcomes us - but can't let us enter, unless we're willing to prove our worth to the city. We are to beseech the witch Baba Lysaga in the ruins of Berez—Areia interrupts him by shout-asking after a map, but of course he doesn't have one— to perform a scrying spell, to discern the location and condition of a person. I will give you all the materials you need, plus a gift to gain her favor.

Oliver questions whether the baron asks such a task of all the visitors. He nods, and says: only those who prove their worth are allowed into the city.

Q: where? Baron Krezkov: back where you came from. Lunar River crossroads, turn southeast there.

We confer amongst ourselves awhile.

Oliver shouts up to the Baron that we will do his task. He lowers a basket on a rope toward us. Inside is a small bundle of hair, a gold bracelet inset with carvings of wolves and ravens. "You will need those strands of hair for the scrying; the bracelet is to purchase her favor." He tells us that the witch is to scry for his son, who has gone missing.

Having all we need, we set off toward the witch. We reach the Raven River crossroad with no issue, where we see the fresh carcass of a dire wolf laid across the road. Its face and side are pierced with hundreds of needlelike thorns, and a pool of 

flurry of feathers, unkindness of ravens takes to the skies from trees nearby, panicked cries in the air. thicket beneath them: sound of numerous inhuman footsteps, horde (10 ish) of shambling thorned figures. they don't seem to have noticed us yet.

We quickly hide, with a boost from Quiyra's *pass without trace*. We see that the figures are made of wood, and are heading toward the Wizard of Wines. The ravens are also flying in that direction. We discuss and agree that we'll probably end up checking out the Wizard of Wines at some point, but the horde of plant monsters indicates more power and danger than we want to just blithely stumble into.

it's not long before forest edge pulls away from river and road. this area is marshy, the river encircling a small isle with evergreen trees. Not far from the road is a small peninsula with a mossy stone slab standing just under 6ft tall, resting on an old stone circle.

Raven saw: a horde of way more of those creatures, practically an army. they seemed to be raiding the vinyard.

In the distance, we see the peaks of Mount Ghakis on the other side of the road. The mist here is quite thick, muffling sound as the road grows muddy and wet. Soon, we are in front of a tall and gnarled tree, very ancient, that thrusts upward in the mist like an obelisk. Rusted metal cages hang from its dead branches, and strands of old spiderwebs cling to its trunk. An enormous bird crafted from burlap and animal skins sits atop a dead branch, its goat-shaped head looking at us with cold black eyes. With a low shriek, it spreads its wings and takes to the air.
We continue forward, the dirt and grass dissolving into marshy, spongy earth. A thick shroud of fog covers everything this side of the river
On the other side of the river is ring of standing stone, copse of trees covered in thick bluish webs.
Before us, the trail splits into two soggy paths. One path runs alongside the river, the other curls inland. Throughout the marsh are scattered older peasant cottages, their walls mildewed and roofs caved in. These cottages seem almost hunkered down, as if they've given up on escaping the mud. Everywhere we look are black clouds of flies, and before us are two old scarecrows lashed to wooden posts, their burlap faces seeming to look straight at us. We see a light flashing from beyond the scarecrows, and the silhouette of a woman emerging from the mist.
She seems to be human, a Barovian by her raven-black hair and sharp features. Not old, in her 30s probably. She eyes us, then crosses her arms and says, "Mother Lysaga has summoned you to her cottage. Follow me if you wish to reach it safely."

We acquiesce and follow her. She leads us to a ramshackle wooden hut set above the ground by a tree stump, the sound of a soft lullaby emanating from the open doorframe, though muffled by cawing ravens. Cages hang from the hut, inside of which are a number of ravens, squawking and flapping their wings. On top of the hut, the birdlike construct from before perches. Our guide stops, and announces "Mother Lysaga, the travelers are here" before waving us to approach.

We climb up the stump into the hut, which is 15 x 15 ft, cluttered with old furniture. In the middle is a ghastly wooden crib, with a small angelic child in it. All the furniture besides the crib is bolted to the floor.
Beneath the crib, a green light seeps up through the cracks between the floorboards.
Almost-monstrous-looking old woman is humming a lullaby to the child.
