## Day 6, cont

Baba Lysaga isn't touching the child, just admiring it as she hums the lullaby. She takes notice of our presence, but doesn't break off.

child has black hair, but much shorter than the sample Krezkov gave us. The child isn't Krezkov's son, as expected.

Quiyra, cautiously, to Baba Lysaga: is this a bad time?
Lysaga interrupts her lullaby, asks if she can do something for us. Facial expression: kindly granny.
Quiyra explains roughly what we're here for.

Lysaga asks that we first pluck a feather from a raven outside and offer it to the baby.

Quiyra cautiously asks: why?
Lysaga: ravens are the birds of prophecy. the fate of a royal child should be exalted above all others.
Areia and Quiyra wonder how Lysaga ended up caring for this child: she's his nanny.
Quiyra wonders: I didn't know there was royalty in Barovia
Lysaga: oh, you know, the von Zarovich family
Areia: what!? strahd has a son!?
Lysaga doesn't respond to this

Quiyra gets sent out to pluck a feather.
She casts *speak with animals*, the verbal components covered up by the raven cries.
they're yelling "bitch! bitch! witch! bitch!"
quiyra raven bear heist:
- quiyra tells the ravens, I can get you out but I need a feather from you first.
- The ravens agree violently, so she plucks a feather ("ow!")
- She tells the ravens: when I'm inside, wait a bit, then start yelling real loudly at the bears.
- She casts conjure animals for two brown bears.
- She instructs the bears: when the ravens yell at you, smash the cages, then flee into the woods.
quiyra goes back inside, puts the feather in the crib - it falls through the baby and through the crib

at this point, the ravens go crazy. the bears smash the cages, allowing the ravens to fly away. Lysaga yells, "what's going on?" and looks outside. She notices the bears, and starts casting a spell, but they're already running away. She dismisses them with a "pesky bears!" and asks again after our request.

She takes the bracelet as payment, and asks us to go fetch a goat from her pen.
There's no gate, but the phrase "Death to Ravenovia" will let us pass.

There are four goats there. Areia simply picks up one of the goats; the goat isn't happy about this arrangement, but can do little about it.

When we return, we see Baba Lysag holding a rusted, bloodstained dagger. She points at the baththub and asks Areia to hold the goat there. After checking with Oliver, she complies.

Baba Lysaga quickly slits the goat's throat, letting its blood spill into the bathtub. Its death fills the hut with the metallic smell of fresh blood. At Lysaga's instruction, Areia sets the goat down outside.

Lysaga orders us to silence as she casts.

With the dripping dagger clutched in one shriveled hand, Baba Lysaga begins to trace strange, arcane symbols across the surface of the goat’s blood with the other, her fingers leaving trails of eerie, shimmering magic.

> The light in the room dims as the shadows grow darker, the air stilled by an eerie silence broken only by the witch’s murmuring incantations.
>
> Magic seeps from her fingertips, flowing like water into the tub of blood. Gradually, the crimson pool begins to ripple and churn, shimmering with silvery light—and then abruptly stills, now as smooth and reflective as a mirror. Baba Lysaga leans forward to peer into the pool, her eyes flickering with a gleam of interest and cruelty.
>
> “I see a boy,” she hisses, “adolescent, shaggy-haired, and claw-scarred.” Her voice is a mixture of intrigue and mockery, and she licks her lips in obvious amusement. “They have collared him with silver, and chained him to a post. There he sits, huddled and pathetic. His eyes, oh, they are hidden, buried in his knees as he snivels and sobs.”
>
> She frowns, as if concentrating, and her voice drops to a rasping whisper. “The post is in a cavern—a dismal chamber lit by flickering torchlight. There is another youth beside him—pale-faced and chained to the wall. I see a statue of a woman, wolf-headed—an idol to Mother Night, adorned in garlands and surrounded by a bounty of treasure. Rotting corpses hang from the walls around her, and a she-wolf lies curled upon the floor at her feet. It bears the gift of Mother Night—I can smell it.”
>
> Lysaga’s fingers twitch—and the blood returns to its previous state, rippling faintly as the magic dissipates.

As soon as we get out, the woman that brought us here starts walking away, escorting us out and away.

We decide to check out the vinyard.

> We hear sounds of battle, but the fog has grown so thick that we can barely see more than sixty feet in any direction. Suddenly, the fog takes on the forms of soldiers on horseback charging across the field. They collide with armored pike-bearers wearing devil-horned helms. As each soldier falls in battle, it turns to fading mist. Hundreds more soldiers collide in a storm of screams and clashing metal.
> 
> We hear a thunderous roar, and seconds later a huge dragon made of silver mist glides overhead, dispersing enemy soldiers with each flap of its mighty wings. Its long, reptilian tail slices through the air above us as the dragon carves a swath through the fog, affording us a fleeting glimpse of a dark mansion overlooking the valley from a cliff above us.

After some arguing from Quiyra, we change course, noting that the path toward the mansion is that unlabeled dirt path branching off the road which we passed earlier on our way to Krezk. It takes us south, up a craggy mountain spur.

We walk for perhaps 20 minutes, before we see in front of us something staring from the treeline. A figure clad in rusted armor steps forth from the underbrush, quite similar to the other revenants we encountered on the bridge. He bids us halt and asks after our business; we admit to curiosity after the mist-phantasm battle.

Sir Godfrey will await us in the chapel of mourning, east side of mansion of Argynvostholdt. However, beware: many unquiet spirits in the manor. Be warned, be careful.

We walk another 20 minutes or so, then reach the crumbling manor on a promontory over the river valley. ⅓ of the structure is collapsed, as is the roof. Dark octagonal tower rises above the architecture.

Out of the fog, we head a thunder and the howling of wolves in the woods below.

Perched atop a 10 ft cube of granite is a 10 ft tall moss-covered statue of a dragon, wings close to body; the statue looks west, away from the mansion. There is no inscription or anything of the sort, but it's a noble silver dragon.

Before we go in, Quiyra summons a pair of giant spiders to assist with things. We climb up the front steps to the entrance, iron-banded wooden doors with dragon knockers. Carved into the arch above is the name of the place: Argynvostholt.

The doors open at our push. We find ourselves inside a once-grand entrance hall. Lots of stone, balconies and arches. A faded tapestry of a nobleman in silver armor. 6 sets of double doors. Along the walls, three alabaster busts of handsome men. A fourth bust and pedestal are knocked over and shattered. Two iron chandeliers above us, looking almost like spiders.

Quiyra remembers that the first revenant we encountered on the road to Vallaki already sent us here.

We enter a feast hall. Long table, chairs carved into dragon wings, still-glowing cryustal chandelier, life-sized statues of knights in alcoves, with dragon-winged helms and shields. Rainwater trickles in, flowing down the west wall into a large puddle.
5 sets of doors; NE doors are open. Stained glass panes, partially broken. Beyond: a dark misty room, apparently a chapel.
Cracked wooden pillars sporting a wooden U-shaped balcony. narrow archways, spiral staircase.
door, set into north wall, barred by wooden beam. east of chapel: stone altar, flanked by wooden candelabras. the altar has a rising sun bias, tall arching windows with panels of stained glass on wall behind altar. one of them shattered, letting in thick fog. rusted wrought-iron lantern from each of the 6 pillars, their glass fogged with age, emitting cold wispy light.
a knight stands between two of the pillars, arms outstretched.
strands of black wire ensnare his chest, more looping down around his biceps and gauntlets and pillars around.
armor and helm corroded, cracked, blackened. Strands of silver hair hang limp. Flesh pallid, barely pink. Skin stretched over sharp skeletal cheekbones, head slumped forward. As we take a step forward into the chapel, his head lifts, revealing red eyes that flash with a quiet intensity. He flexes against his bindings, and then we notice the wires bear tiny barbs.

He welcomes us and asks us to forgive his rudeness.
He is indeed Sir Godfrey Willem, Knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon. He asks what brings us here, and we report why.
This was on his orders: the hour is dire and he has need of our aid.
Long ago, before the mists descended upon the valley, the Order of the SD was an order dedicated to justivce and protecting the weak. Founded by Lord Argynvost, very good. Only Godfrey and his most dedicated knights knew he was really a silver knight.
Not 10 years later, Strahd brought war to the valley. The order fought Strahd's armies and sheltered refugees, but ultimately found itself driven back into the valley and then to Argynvostholt.
Areia and Oliver say yes. Jasper and Quiyra are silent

There was a great battle on the floodplains east, many knights slaughtered. I and my commander, Vladimir Hornguard, led a final attack against enemy general's camp. Commander Hornguard was killed by Zarovich himself, and I met my fate at the hands of his second-in-command, a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars.
Several years later, I felt Commander Hornguard's rage pulling my soul from beynd the grave, and found myself and the other knghts returned as revenants.
We learned Strrahd had desecrated Argynvost's remains and taken them as trophy to 
We reneewed fight against Strahd, until the mists overtook 
Vistani crone, Eva, met us at castle gates. Told us Strahd died and had been reborn, he and all barovia now captives of the mist.
Is there any you hate, within or beyond the valley? Would you condemn all you lvoe to death and despair, if only to ensure the one you hate suffers?
We all say we don't hate anyone that much. Oliver takes a principled stance against eternal suffering.
Knight says, you stand amongst ruins of one who chose vengeance > love.
Commander returned to Argynvostholt, where he forbade kngihts from fighting Strahd.
Later, he expanded his interdiction to Strahd's servants and preachers, believeing that Strahd's minions would only drive him to deeper pain and misery. For what is a conqueror without anything left to conquer?
The knights reluctantly obeyed, even as they watched the peopel of Barovia sink into depsiar.
As strahd slumbered in his tomb, many came to believe barovia's nightmare may one day lift.
Until a knight came bearing news of failed rebellion from a village, Barovia, and strahd's threat to wipe the village.
Quarrel erupted: kngiths demand right to defend village, Hornguard angerily banished other kngiths. Only I, restrained by my bindings, was allowed to remain. 
These shackles, forged from my oath to Hornguard and the order. Corrupted by undeath, the something something defiance in his heart.
The reason I have summoned you here is: Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers here.
The spirit appeared to Hornguard, urging him away from his path of vengeance, but unsuccessfully, so the spirit gradually fell silent.
Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost's spirit began to stir again. It's now too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts here claim to have heard him whisper of a new generation of heroes and a new, final front in the fight against darkness.
When the knghtts were banished, I sent them to seek those who Aergynvost spoke of. Perhaps you're who he was waiting for.

Oliver promises that those dead who linger here should pass on properly, be unshackled and freed to go on to their eternal rest. The knight smiles at this, and asks us to explore the mansion on his behalf. Investigate the spirits that lurk within, uncover the knowledge of Argynvost's whispers.
He warns us to avoid the audience hall on the west end of 3rd floor: there, commander hornguard still lurks. He mustn't hear us, as he doesn't take kindly to outsiders or those who seek Strahd's destruction. In life he was the best of us, and in death he has grown even more powerful. Even if Strahd himself slew him, he would come back.
You should also know: not all of the masion's spirits are friendly. Some are stuck in the moment of their deaths, reliving it by fighting anyone they encounter. They can't be dissuaded, and it would take great stgrength of arms to overcome them; but they can be deceived.
Travel south from the lunar river crossroads, to a point where the river briefly becomes a small lake with an island. There is an ancient stone slab. 200 steps from here, a river rock final resting place of ~1000 souls. Some still bear the liveries of the order. Clothed in their garments, the maddened spirits that haunt these halls will allow us to come and go in peace, but Vladimir won't be fooled by such tricks.
Oli: tell me, Godfrey: do you tire of lingering here?
He shakes his head. I am eternal, and I will not be able to rest until our mission is complete; no matter the suffering I will have to go through, I will see the Devil slain.
Oli swears: When the devil's head lies on a platter, you will find rest in the halls of the lord of the dead.
Knight retorts: when the devil loses his head, Vladimir's soul will decide if it is our time to go.

Quiyra agrees that we will do this, but it's a big project. She points out that we have other shit to do today, and we're not really ready to explore this mansion right now. The other party members agree.

Oliver once again expresses his hopes and goals to see this place cleansed and its undead laid to rest. Godfrey thanks him/us, deeply.

Half-OOC discussion, traveling between any two of Krezk / Wizard of Wines / Argynvostholt takes 5ish hours. If we go to the WoW as previously planned, we would have to stay the night there or else travel and arrive at Krezk long after nightfall, since it is already mid-late afternoon.

Quiyra asks Areia to carry her so she can rest on the road, and turns into a squirrel when the latter acquiesces.
