## Day 6, cont²

we're back at the raven river crossroads. the revenant on the bridge just nods at us and lets us pass.

go left toward wizard of wines.

soon see young woman leaning against tree, arms crossed, short, dusky skin, jetblack hair, black eyes, mudstained short cloak/mantle, dark feather necklace, wooden crossbow hanging from back, shortsword sheathed at her hip.

she looks at us, waves with one hand, twirls her hair with the other - she has a bright blue streak running through it. We wave back, Quiyra jumps down and stops being a squirrel

she was waiting for us on the word of uncle Urwyn. we're puzzled at this, but she knows Areia's name.

her name is Muriel. she's waiting here for us to help her free the winery (from the plant monsters).

Oliver asks for the situation. She doesn't know, as she was told to wait here first.

Muriel remarks that we don't quite look the adventuring type- except Areia, who notes this is her first time, actually!

We set off. A little later, we hear a twig snap nearby. Quiyra and Jasper spot a human silhouette in the trees. It s a broadshouldwered woman, clad in muddy furs with a stone axe, obsidian ornaments hanging, mud smeared on face as camo.

as we make eye contact, she runs away. Areia asks if she should go after the woman; Muriel says no, she's one of the mountainfolk. They're not dangerous, unless attacked; they just live in the mountains.

Muriel doesn't know why the mountainfolk was watching the road, but notes that MF have been more active lately. perhaps they're looking for something.

Path narrows as it winds through the woods, gray light struggling to pierce the canopy. can feel a musky, earthy aroma, like rotting leaves, damp soil, and a faint tang of decay. vegetation here is denser, low-hanging branches draped with clumps of vines that weave a tangled tapestry against the undergrowth.
thick blanket of pine needles etc crunching beneath our boots.

Muriel mutters, something ain't right: road didn't smell like death last time she was here. Quiyra asks about the vines: were they always here? Muriel doesn't know.

Quiyra spots a pit trap, possibly spiked, covered by vegetation. It is indeed not supposed to be there. We go on alert, but continue forward.

As we bypass the trap, we spot five figures (vine blights) emerging from the underbrush: more of the vine monsters. Combat:

Areia: rage, summoning glaive; run in, attack twice recklessly: 25 hits for 8 p, 22 hits for 15 p.
Muriel: run in, shortsword the same vineblight twice. miss, hit; finishing it off. step around.
Jasper: handxbow: 11 miss, 25 hit at another blight. box shoves it in the pit, it falls and gets impaled for 14 p.
vine blight: slap areia, hit thanks to reckless
Oliver: retaliate against the areia-slapper with a stabby dagger, 12 hits for 16 p, offhand another 3 p.
vine blight: slap oliver, just misses
quiyra: reposition, thornwhip the last vine blight: 26 hit for 4 p, yoink it into the pit.
vine blights: stand, try to climb out.

Areia: reckless retaliate against the oliver-slapper: 14 hits for 7 p, 14 hits for 6 p.
Muriel: slice up the areia-slapper, 21 hits for 6 p finishing it off. She seems to be enjoying the fight. Reposition around Oliver to attack the Oliver-slapper, 23 hits for 5 p.
Jasper: handxbow: 9 miss, 25 hit for 7 p against the blight Quiyra pitter. Box moves to the Oliver-slapper and misses it.
Oliver: stab his slapper dead, 23 hits for 16 p, reposition around the pit.
Quiyra: run around the pit, thorn whip the vine blight below her. It just dies without even needing to be dropped on the spike again.
Vine blight: try to attack Oliver, get messed up by the box.

Areia: recklessly attack the last blight. 10 miss, 22 hit for 7 p.
Muriel: finish off that last blight.

Muriel comments on Areia's use of magic, having taken her for more of a "one-two type". We all agree that Areia stands out (except in a dense crowd, 'cuz she's short). Muriel remarks on her horns and stares at her tail for a bit, much to Areia's confusion.

Muriel asks if we're all from outside Barovia. Quiyra readily confirms this, since most of us don't exactly blend in; Muriel remarks that Oliver could pass for a Barovian just fine.

Muriel asks about the world outside Barovia; we give her a collective shrug, since it's big. It s brighter, perhaps. She sighs, wishing she could leave; but the Devil decides who can leave.

forest clears up, path widens. by the side: old stone slab, standing just under 6ft in height, resting on an old cracked stone circle, bearing some carvings. The carving is a wolf over a three-pointed star; this one has no moss, no dirt. Muriel knows this, but only as a symbol of old Barovian gods.

after 0.5 miles: road becomes a muddy trail, see a mist-shrouded meadow. trail splits: west into the valley, or south into dark woods. Wooden signpost on west trail: "Vineyard". We continue following Muriel, who naturally is going west.

unpainted fences along th trail, which is north of a vineyard before bending south toward a stately manor.

rope-handled half-barrels for hauling grapes. large stand of trees north of the trail, man standing there in a cowled cloak beckoning us. Muriel informs us that this is Davian, and we approach him.

he vanishes into a small grove of smooth, gray-barked trees. the canopy here is dense, casting the forest in shadow. these trees are very symmetrical and uniform, dozens of ravens perched on them. figure's nowhere to be seen, but a well-disguised trapdoor is pulled open in the clearing, revealing a shaft with a ladder.

Muriel doesn't recognize it. Out of an abundance of caution, Quiyra conjures a raven to send down, and as soon as she does, an old man pops out, yelling at us to get down there instead of wasting time. She deposits the raven on her shoulder.

You descend the wooden ladder, each step echoing faintly in the enclosed space as the rungs creak beneath your weight. Overhead, heavy raindrops drum against the closed trapdoor with a relentless rhythm, the muffled sound of booming thunder echoing far above. Rivulets of rainwater run down the damp stone walls around you, pooling in a sloshing, watery pit thirty feet below.

Halfway down the shaft, the walls open up into a small stone cavern, its rough walls damp and glistening. Lanterns hang from iron hooks that jut out from the walls, their flickering flames filling the space with the warm glow of candlelight. The perimeter of the cavern hosts a collection of crates and sacks, which appear to have been kept in relatively good condition. A tunnel stretches away from the south wall of the cave, a thin layer of mist clinging to its floor as it vanishes into darkness.

Bedrolls and blankets are strewn across the rough cavern floor, occupied by an assortment of adults and children. Two men bearing a striking resemblance to Urwin Martikov lean against the western wall—the elder with dark hair tinged slightly with gray, and the younger bearing softer features and a mop of brownish hair.

A woman kneels beside a pair of young boys not far away, her angular features framed by locks of chestnut hair. A bald, broad-shouldered man with a darker complexion sits beside her, cradling an infant sleeping peacefully in his arms. A teenager showing a blend of the man and woman's features sits with his knees held to his chest a few feet beyond, a half-whittled stick clutched in his hands.
The cloaked figure stands at the head of the group, the cowl of his cloak lowered to reveal the features of a man in his elder years. His gray, suspicious eyes scowl back at you, framed by strands of silver-gray hair that cascade down to his shoulders from the receding hairline along his scalp. His face is bronzed and weathered, and the wrinkles above his eyebrows split his forehead like furrowed troughs.

The patched green cloak he wears has clearly seen better days, but appears to have been proudly decorated with clusters of raven's feathers meticulously sewn into the cowl and shoulders, as well as a menagerie of nearly a dozen old pewter medallions and trinkets that have been haphazardly stitched into the fabric. His weight leans against an old wooden cane, its wide surface carved with intricate patterns of grapes and vines, and his thick fingers tap impatiently against its edge.

Old man-Davian- greets Muriel, asks who we're supposed to be. Muriel: the people sent by Urwyn. Davian scoffs at 

4 days ago, four forestfolk druids invaded the WOW and drove them out; that's why they're hidden here. The druids are accompanied by several dozen blights, created by gulthias tree, as well as three greater strixes created by the swamp witch in Berez. The strixes have been patrolling the skies, preventing their escape.
He doesn't know why they did this, why they're still here, or why the swamp witch would assist them. He also asks what our interest is.

Oliver: previously it was just curiosity, but now we're here to help.

Davian: 4 druids, 8 needle blights, 8 vine blights, few dozen twig blights. skies guarded by 3 greater strixes, vineyard by too many twig blights to count.

druid leader has a strange magical staff, seems to be the source of all the blights and their strength as well as the control method. breaking that should help.

safest route in is a tunnel from this cavern to a secret door in the winery cellar.

Quiyra knows nothing specific about that staff.

Greater Strix is that stitched birdthing that launches spines. 

One of the people in the background starts muttering stuff along the lines of, "they're just going to die anyway". The woman, likely the boy's mother, starts scolding the teenager, orders him to apologize to us. She also immediately apologizes on his behalf. Oliver reassures him.

Quiyra asks with great interest about this "gulthias tree". It's an evil tree, Davian doesn't know its story. It's a source of evil magic, there is just one: in Barovia, specifically the Yesterhael?? which is near-ish, he recommends staying away: it's a place of great evil.

He warns us: the tunnel is filled with brown mold, which they use to keep the wine cool. stick to the center, don't mess with the mold. Quiyra knows: it's a mold that feeds on heat. touching it is very bad for you: you could freeze to death.

Also: careful of the druids. they can conjure the force of thunder, which can alert the others. He suggests we stay quiet, and notest that the storm outside should cover up combat noises. Also: the winery is made of wood, do not set it on fire if any of you are the spellcasting type. Quiyra notes that she is, but not of the fiery kind: she's a druid. Muriel confirms this, having seen Quiyra unsquirrelform.

Muriel also declares that she'll stay behind here in case any danger comes, but will join us as soon as she can if the situation allows.

After confirming that we're ready to go, Quiyra casts *pass without trace* and we go.

We march silently through the tunnel. There is a thin veil of mist clinging to the ground, and it's frigidly cold; we can see our breaths in the air. It soon opens to a shallow freezing cavern, carpeted with brown mold interrupted only by a dirt path to a dark stone archway.

Approaching the arhway, we see a stonework tunnel terminating in a blank brick wall. Full of brown mold. short way down the tunnel: small wooden box, hanging from rusted iron hook, painted frigid blue with sign of a snowflake carved on it. there's a 15cm bare patch around it on the wall with no mold. We send Jasper's box out front.

At the end of that tunnel is the secret door, which can just be pushed open from this side

cellar is unseasonably warm. it's split in two by a wall, serving as wine storage. both racks covered by vines, some blights.

6 needle blights, one probably-druid with a staff and an antler headdress. We get ready to rush down this druid with the advantage of surprise. Thanks to PWT, we do indeed surprise this group.

Round 1 (w/ surprise):
Oliver: first attack with advantage from stealth, 25 hits for 16 p.
Jasper: run in, two shots at the druid. first shot adv, 24 hits for 7 p. second shot, 10 miss. box grapples a blight, but fails.

Jasper: back up out of melee. blight OA, box gives it disadvantage: 7 misses. handxbow shot, 15 hits for 7 p. Again, 23 hits for 11 p, dead. Box goes to rend another blight, 24 hits for 8 force.
Quiyra: finish off the blight Jasper shot with a thornwhip, step out of sight.

Round 3:
Oliver: stab a blight to death. offhand attack hits another for 4 p.
blight: claw Areia, miss. Oliver sentinel: 19 hit for 17 p, dead.

Areia asks if the druid's staff is what we were looking for. Quiyra says no, but break it anyway, which Areia does. Oliver use his amulet's *gentle repose* on the druid, bidding her to rest well.

We look around, seeing three paths:
- one is a ramp to the right, blocked off by many many vines.
	- a similar kind of vine, thought slightly different, wraps around the wine racks. It has some purple thorns.
- a spiral staircase, to the left (stone)
- a straight staircase, bottom wall

We go for the spiral staircase. Quiyra sends the raven up the staircase to scout.
