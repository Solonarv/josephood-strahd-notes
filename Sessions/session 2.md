## Day 0 (still)
we search the next room for anyting of interest.

music room: drapes over window, brass-plated chandelier, lotsa padded chair, stained glass wall hangings: children&adults singing, playing. harpsichord, harp near fireplace. above fireplace: alabaster figurines of dancers. smell: wet dog, except dried now. Oliver checks in the harpsichord: nothing.

next floor up (the floor with the dead undead guy). we go to the nursery, where oliver checks over the mirror. it's a mirror. Q has her own try and fly into the mirror, but it just bonks its head on the glass. We keep looking and don't find anything.

We suspect something behind the mirror. Q knocks on the wall, and it sounds hollow. Areia and Jasper try to move the mirror out of the way, and manage to push it inward (it's hinged), revealing a staircase. We head up it. There's a door that opens onto the attic. It's very dusty and full of cobwebs, just like floor 3.

Door 1: locked. Oliver can't pick it, so Areia kicks it open. The room beyond looks like a child's. bricked-up window, two wood-framed beds (dusty). toy chest with windmills painted on, dollhouse replica of this house. lying in the middle of the floor, two tattered skeletons. also a doll. they match the kids and doll we saw outside the house.

Door 2: small room, similar to the servants' bedroom. nothing unusual about it. bed, nightstand (drawers empty), rocking chair, empty open wardrobe.

Door 3: super dusty. chairs coatracks mirrors mannequins. all draped in white sheets. bloodstained trunk near iron stove. Oliver tries to open the trunk, succeeds. inside is a skeleton dressed in the same clothing the ghost of the nurse was wearing, except with stab holes in the front.

owl flies around outside. the children are gone, and there's no outside entrance to the basement.

Door 4: another spare bedroom. only difference: this one has a desk and a doll is smiling dressed in a lacy yellow dress. Q has her owl poke the doll with a wingtip, to no effect.

We give all the rooms a once-over, knocking on walls to check for any other hollow spaces.

Oliver takes care of the dead children's room. As soon as he starts, the children's ghosts appear, staring at their own skeletons. Their skin starts shifting color to blue, their clothing changes. They start weeping. The girl looks at Oliver and asks him if they're really dead. He confirms, and promises to ensure they'll rest well. The boy is upset, screaming, crying. His sister tries to comfort him, not very successfully. She asks why they died, and asks for their parents. We tell them we found their father, but not their mother. Perhaps she's in the basement, could they show us the way there?

She says she knows where it is, and goes to the dollhouse. Inside of it are tiny twisted dolls, resembling us, in the children's room; along with two tipped-over dolls, representing the children. Downstairs is the doll for their father, also tipped over. She points at a wall in the storage room, and as soon as her finger passes the wall, we hear a loud noise of stone grinding. She looks at us and begs us to save her brother. We tell her it may be too late, but promise to do what we can.

She asks us to take their bones with them and put them in their crypt. We agree. Their crypt is in the basement. The kids sit down, mute, waiting. We gather up their bones and head to the storage room.

A spiral staircase is revealed there. We descend, Areia leading the way, and find ourselves in some basement tunnels. It's quite cold down there. "artificial dungeon". As soon as we arrive there, we hear some indistinct chanting, but can't understand the words not hear where it's coming from because of the echoing walls.

Q scouts with her owl.

mouldy skeletons hangfing from rusty shckles along walls. wooden statue pale gaunt man big cloak, hand resting on head of wolf, smoy gray crystal orb on other hand.

owl keeps exploring. enters a bedroom. gurgling low voice: "who's there?" from a the mother's painting in there (paintings of mother&father). tells the owl to go away.

go toward source of chanting, down even more stairs. chanting becomes clear: he is the ancient, he is the land. quite loud, many voices. stairs lead into reliquary. mummified yellow hand, knife, dagger, orb, aspergiliom, cloak, frog, small bag, finger, figurine of mummy, pendant, shrunken head, small box.

iron bars, water, room filled with ~knee-deep sewery water, stinky. octagonal dais in the center, with a bloodcrusted sacrifice altar and two shackles dangling from the ceiling. chanting is coming from this room, but can't see anyone.

smooth masonry walls, here. the rest of the dungeon looked rough, almost natural. quite the contrast. quite clean (aside from the water). stone pillars supporting the ceiling. breach on opposite wall, leading to small alcove with murky water and pile of mold, bones, trash, and so on.

more exploration: prison cells, all except one (skeleton) empty.

back to our level: small guest rooms around a well. crypt. 

we deposit the children's remains in the crypt first, since it's right here. Oliver does that, saying a prayer to Kelemvor over it to hopefully help them rest. Their ghosts appear again, and start dissolving. They look at us, weeping, tinged with a smile of relief.

we head downstairs. there's a spike trap in a a corridor on the way, which quiyra barely dodges. we get to the reliquary for real now.

relics:
- A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin’s hand) on a loop of rope
- A knife carved from a human bone
-  A dagger with a rat’s skull set into the pommel
-  An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic’s eye
-  An aspergillum carved from bone
-  A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
-  A desiccated frog lashed to a stick
-  A bag full of bat guano
-  A hag’s severed finger
-  A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest
-  An iron pendant adorned with a devil’s face
-  The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
-  A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf’s withered tongue

Quiyra duskwalks into the waterlogged room after the owl. The chanting stops, and inside the room 12 humanoid figures appear, dressed in all black tunics. They don't say a word, and probably can't speak because inside their hoods is just a black void. They're holding unlit candles.

Q opens the bars, mostly ignoring the figures. The rest of the party follows. Shortly, a thin layer of mist settles on the floor. The only noise we hear is the splashing of water around our steps, and the smell in here is quite foul.

Something the owl couldn't see is a white bundle the size of a baby, on top of the altar - even though it looked there. Oliver and Areia approach it. As soon as they step food on the octagonal dais, the figures' candles light up again, and the start chanting again: one must die! one must die!

Areia looks inside the bndle. rusted serrated dagger, with blood on it.

Meanwhile, Jasper and Quiyra check out the mound of refuse. Jasper's chest pokes it with an appendage; nothing happens.

We look around to try and find out if there is anything alive here, other than us. We ponder how to satisfy 

Quiyra has an idea: Quiyra slays her owl. It drips blood into the water, which implausibly all turns red, though not for long: it all gets sucked inside the mound of refuse. The voices chant: the end comes! death be praised, over and over. The room starts to quake. We try to just flee.

skill challenge time!

1. room is shaking, ceiling collapsing, trash heap taking form. we hear a distorted, disgusted baby's cry.
2. as we run to the entrance, the iron bars slam shut. Areia heaves on the wheel, but it's stuck; instead she prys open the bars enough for us to pass through. (d20+5=25)
3. back upstairs, we head in the direction that didn't have a trap. Grasping hands come out of the ground; Quiyra catches them in *entangle*, and they grasp the thorny brambles, seeming to mistake them for living flesh.
4. We make it back up the spiral staircase, to the storage room. The house has changed: wood rotten, black tendrils everywhere. As we reach the stairs leading down, we come faces to mandibles with a giant spider! Jasper's box knocks it over in a surge of mechanical strength, allowing us to pass.
5. We return to the nursery. The scene her is quite disturbing: the door to outside has been replaced with scythes and rotating blades. On the bed is a woman giving birth. She's screaming in pain. A well-dressed man is pacing the room. The mother is screaming at her maids. The blades speed up as the mother's contractions increase. Oliver tries to jam the mechanism, it keeps going, and getting through costs us time as well as blood.
6. On the landing, the armor has come to life, and is going after Oliver trying to encase him foreverrrrr. Areia smashes the sword she found on the mantlepiece earlier into the armor, recklessly. She scatters the armor's pieces, and we make it past and down the stairs before it manages to collect its pieces again.
7. A dog has joined us. It's scared. We keep running down.
8. We arrive on the ground floor. It's devastated. The dog is scratching at the (closed) entrance, while the house is filling with some sort of gas. Oliver quickly unlocks the door and we are finally outside.
9. As soon as we're all out, the house starts collapsing. Its facade looked almost like a face. The only thing left: broken wood, broken glass. The dog is still with us.

Jasper inspects the dog, while Quiyra tries (and fails) to calm down the dog. It shies back from her, tail between its legs. To Jasper, it just looks like a malnourished dog. He puts down some rations, which the dog cautiously nibbles on.

As the adrenaline fades, we notice that, outside of the gate, there is a basket. Quiyra goes to inspect it, since it puts her somewhere the dog isn't. Inside are two wine bottles, some grapes, and a thank-you note.

Quiyra picks up the notes.
> Thank you for cleaning this vermin off of my domain. Your efforts are appreciated, even if for just one night. Please accept this small gift to help your recovery. Welcome to Barovia. -S

Below the other stuff is a small wooden box containing four potions. Jasper checks them: they're healing potions. We distribute them, one each.

Our next objective: go to Barovia (the village), talk to Madam Eva, figure out what to do from there.

We set off on the road. We decide that it's probably fine to sample Strahd's gifts; if he wanted to poison us he would have easier ways.

After just a few minutes we notice we're being followed. There's a raven with blue-tipped wings, looking at us. Though perhaps it's just flying in our general direction. It flies off ahead, and we don't see it again.

After an hour of walking, we see smoke ahead of us, probably from a village. As we approach further, it takes shape. In the distance we see indeed a village, houses built mostly of stone. Tall shapes of buildings, muddy ground. After some time the muddy road shifts to wet cobblestone. The tall shapes resolve into village dwellings. There are wooden gates (open), and inside we see quite the desolate village: there is nobody outside, at least not that we can see at a distance. We reach the gate, which is unguarded, and enter. There are a few people around, outside, pointedly not looking at us or walking faster so they don't meet our gaze. Only one person doesn't do this: an old lady pushing a cart, which is stuck.

We approach her, and Quiyra frees the cart with a quick *mold earth*. She thanks us effusively and introduces herself as Morgantha. She confirms this is indeed Barovia, and offers to show us around. We accept; she needs to tour the village anyway, as she sells pastries. She offers us some, and gets to chatting with Oliver: he makes them too!

Oliver gets a small (15 cm) fruit pie, which he splits with Areia. It's quite good; he compliments it. As we walk, she points out various points of interest around town:
- a shop, with a sign above the door: Bildreth Mercantile, general store.
- Blood of the Vine tavern (also an inn)
- on the long end of the road is the Burgomaster's mansion
- on the other side is the church.
People buy pies from her every so often, and she charges 1 gp each. Very expensive! The coins are embossed with a profile picture of a man with long hair, matching the statue in the room in the house as well as the figure in the fire when Tanimir told his story.

It's around lunchtime, a bit earlier.

We decide to head to the tavern first, to secure some rooms. The name stems from the sign above the doorway, which used to say "Blood on the Vine" but was scratched. Inside the tavern is quite empty, but a blazing fire burns in the fireplace, giving off a pleasant warmth. There are three Vistani-looking ladies at a table, the barkeep, and one more person at the counter.

We split. Jasper and Quiyra approach the barkeep. Jasper produces a gold coin, explains that we're not from around here, and asks if it's legal tender. The barkeep gives him a dead look, inspects the coin, sighs, and says yes. Rooms are 2sp/person/night, breakfast included. Jasper hands him the gold coin he was holding and receives 2sp in change. We'll get some lunch too.

Meanwhile, Oliver and Areia approach the probably-Vistani, who confirm that they are indeed Vistani. O&A ask after Madam Eva, which brings a smile to the ladies. They ask who's looking for her, so O&A introduce us all. They ask why we're looking for Madam Eva; Oliver explains that other Vistani sent us. They haven't seen her in years, but she should still be at the ??? camp. The camp is not far from here, about a day's walk away. They agree that we should not go now, since we'd have to sleep outside, which is dangerous.

We discuss our next steps: tomorrow, we'll head to the camp. Today, we can explore the village a little.

As we do, we see Morgantha enter the tavern and approach the man sitting alone at the bar. They talk for a bit (roughly: she says she's almost done with her rounds, she'll be departing soon, she met us), then he gets up and approaches us.
