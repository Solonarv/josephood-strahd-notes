# Day 2 (still)
we continue down the road
notice: temps dropping, altitude rising
winding mountain road
far ahead: majestic peaks, barely visible through the mist
air keeps growing colder
road throu dark evergreen forest
thick canopy blocks out scarce daylight
only sound: crunching of fallen leaves, occasional rustling in underbrush

as we round edge of mountain, right hand cliff falls away. gully below. road bends, doubling back around, before plunge dramatically and wind round smaller mountain peak
follow road which clings to side of mountain

arching bridge of mold-encrusted bridge over chasm
base of the bridge: stony gargoyles, black moss, frowns weatherworn
other side: waterfall, misty pool ~300m down, leads to tser pool
pool feeds river which meanders around
bridge quite long
closer: notice, 1 humanoid figure standing in middle of bridge.

we decide: oh well, lets just cross that bridge when we get to it (i.e. now)

we approach. the figure, walking back and forth, walks with the stride and bearing of one who knows no fear. clad in rusty armor, gleaming longsword in its pale hands. ready for a fight
see in its eyes: a hint of intelligence, and hate.
probably undead. we discuss for a moment.

quiyra calls out: ho there! bridge guardian!
it raises its sword, calls halt, and asks our names. we give them, kinda
it asks our business: to Vallaki!
it says old things are stirring, the lord of castle ravenloft roams the valley. do we serve him? No!
he puts his sword away, attempts a smile, bids us approach
Q: name? he is "a knight of the order of the silver dragon. i have long forgotten the name I had in life."
O: why does he linger? it was his purpose in life, the order of his captain. 
also, he suggests - if we really do oppose strahd - that we visit sir godfrey gwln at argynvostold?
home of the order of the silver dragon: west beyond town walls, then south along ashgray path

as we pass, oliver asks quietly if this is what the knight wants to do for however long he'll last. the knight says: this is his purpose, his place.
the knight bows to us as we pass.

it's noonish. Ireena thinks we can make it to Vallaki by nightfall.

we continue down the road. it goes north for a bit, then west. then north again, 2nd hill rising from the path on the left.
few trees on its slops, branches like gnarled fingers
cliffs taller

hills fall away, road into small basin. even here, fog inescapable. dirt road splits in two:
wider east, patches of cobblestone. once an important thoroughfare? a huge castle atop a mountain peak. Almost certainly [Castle Ravenloft](../Places/Castle%20Ravenloft.md). just looking at it: organs play, menacing thunder rolls behind the castle.

other direction does indeed lead somewhere: a different, but familiar view. an imposing long wall, with a gate guarded by two statues. slightly better than the one we entered barovia through, the statues still have their heads.

we continue. we've been walking for ~4 hours. road continues, passing through a patch of dark wood. air quiet as grave, trees perfectly still. not far from the road, in the underbrush: a mossy stone slab, just under 6ft tall. on an old cracked stone circle, some kind of carving on it: a raven over a 3-pointed star. the grooves of the star are lined with lichen/moss.

we continue, road emerges from the wood. we approach a gully between two hills. bends north towards base of mountain. old svalich road transitions from winding mountain path to trail that hugs mountainside as it descends into foggy valley.
in the valley: great walled town at shores of mountain lake.
branch west to promontory with dilapidated stone windmill.
a familiar face going toward Vallaki: the old lady we met, Morgantha. we agree this is odd.

she notices our approach, greets us cheerfully
oliver asks her what she's doing out here: she lives here?
quite the, uh, 'strategic' place: she can easily go to barovia, or to vallaki. in fact she was getting ready to sell some pastries to the poor hungry dears outside vallaki's gates
oliver notes the danger along/on the roads, offers our company. she accepts
she says 'an old woman has her tricks', but agrees that her feet and back don't like it.
she would rather stay in the city a while; Q: oh, why? M: usually she doesn't stay long in vallaki, but this time she's quite tired.
she has a warning for us: the guards at the vallaki gate are confiscating silver coins and visible silver items.
they guards say they need the silver to fight werewolves
Ireena brings up her sword, which is silvered. We discuss a few ways of hiding it; Ireena was just going to wrap it in a bundle and shove it in her pack.
we also notice other silver some of us are carrying

we formulate a plan to smuggle it past the guards: quiyra carries it and wildshapes it away.

we resume walking toward vallaki.
close

tall gnarled trees creep close to the road. rustle wind, creak branches. trees whispering? roots stirring in rotten mulch?
forest swallows road, trees towering on both sides.
air thick, heavy: scent of moss, rotting leaves.
raven's gurgling croak, flapping wings.

our presence here: not unnoticed. a raven follows us for several minutes, keeping a respecrtful distance.
the small raven on quiyra's shoulder hears the croak, answers, flies toward the other raven.
we keep walking.
as we proceed, trees north break: grassy field, tall grass. until shores of dark distant lake. foggy shoreline. even at this distance: water lapping against rocks. ireena freezes.
she wants to take a detour to see the lake shore. seems familiar somehow.
we follow her at a distance. she crouches, touches the water. traces, with her finger, looks at us and says: I think this is the place I dreamt of. and yet she doesn't think she's been here.
quiyra suggests: buried memory? Ireena agrees: possible. her father did find her on the old svalich road.
after a few minutes, she rejoins us, lost in thought.

as quickly as it appeared, the field is swallowed up by the forest again. dark undergrowth rustles and stirs, weight of the forest presses in from all sides. somehow, we're being watched.

quiyra notices: as our footstep squelch on the road, glimpse a flicker of movement in the underwood
grey fur, amber eyes, sharp white teeth.
quiyra warns everyone else

the wolf jumps out! eight more join it.
round 1
a wolf misses areia, and gets stabbed dead by oliver in retaliation
a wolf bites areia, and gets a face full of hellfire for its trouble
oliver aims and throws a dart at the philosophical wolf that jumped out, it dies
a big (smiling were)wolf jumps at oliver from behind. it looks disturbingly humanlike in the face. it almost hits him, but quiyra silverybarbses it at the last moment (advantage to areia)
ireena goes up to the big bad wolf and stabs it.
a polished wolf joins the fight. it lunges at areia and misses.
a lazy wolf misses areia
areia rages and attacks lazy wolf, it lives.
a mature wolf bites areia. it gets stabbed dead by oliver in retaliation.
a calming wolf bites areia
a fabulous wolf bites areia
quiyra webs up the werewolf and two of the other wolves
jasper misses the werewolf with his handxbow, and sends the box to attack the calming wolf. it misses, and steps away to use up the wolf's OA (which hits).

oliver stabs the werewolf; it takes damage even from the mundane hit. he repositions.
the werewolf dodges the webs, misses areia with a bite, and (thanks to barbs, again) misses claws.
ireena stabs the werewolf.

ireena stabs the werewolf
the polished wolf gets webbed and misses areia; oliver misses it
areia recklesly finishes off the fabulous wolf
quiyra tickles the werewolf with a thorny vine
jasper shoots the werewolf dead, center mass.

the werewolf reverts: young man, pale freckled skin, pale muscled frame, bloody raw wound visible on his side
oliver kills the last wolf.

ireena is quite nervous, excited, jittery.

the ravens are still nearby. we stand down, and discuss what to do with the bodies; especially the young man's. oliver bandages areia's bite wounds.

quiyra digs a burial pit for the bodies, and we toss them in. Quiyra finds some flowers for the grave, and carves into a nearby tree: "Here lies an unfortunate young man, lost to the wolves." Oliver says some funeral rites.

morgantha comes out of wherever she hid. we say it's no trouble, oliver scolds her to stay safe.

finally, the road meanders into the valley in which sits vallaki.
thick fog up against the wall. more than a dozen ramshackle tents outside the palisade wall, ragged/emaciated people among them. as we arrive, morgantha nods us thanks and stops there.

the ravens are still following us.

while we're still out of view, quiyra gathers up the silver contraband and turns into a dog. some people recognize ireena dully, but there are no gestures of warmth or recognition. she's clearly heartbroken and enraged. it doesn't take long until she tells us to go ahead and find lodging, she'll meet with her people. Areia hands her the Durst longsword just in case she needs it, but Ireena refuses.

we approach the gate, iron bars. there are two guards, one with a spear that fits through the gaps and one with a crossbow. "welcome to vallaki, travelers. identify yourselves." quiyra whuffs quietly, and everyone else gives their names. there's a 1 gp toll to enter. we pay, and also pay in advance for ireena. before letting us in, they ask for our silver, and promise equivalent in copper. exchange is made. we're welcomed in. all the guards recite: "All will be well!"

once inside, we find a dark alley, where quiyra turns back into an elf and complains about the stink and sensitive dog noses.

earthen road to cobble streets
mud stains
behind us, gates slam closed.
in the distance, two other figures with lights patrolling the walls
eaves of the buildings: old banners, tattered fabrics. faded words and illustrations.
flickering candlelight behind windows
long shadows in alleyways full of long twisted grass
streets empty, though single cloaked figure traveling away
in the distance, lone wolf howl; cold gust of wind
don't know where inn is
we keep walking straight, and find probably-a-tavern: gray smoke from chimney, large two-story building, stone foundation, ravens perched on it including those that were following us.
blue waterfall on painted sign
we enter. quite welcoming: hewn-wood walls, warm and pleasant compared to outside. woman behind the bar: 50ish, black hair with some white, smiles at us. welcome to the Blue Water Inn.
as we approach the bar, a man - looking quite similar to her: same hair; pudgy, her age - comes out from the kitchen with a tray of fresh-baked bread, stew, and steaks. smells delicious.
he also smiles and welcomes us. he correctly guesses that we're travelers looking for a place to stay the night.
the woman steps in before he can offer us free rooms, though he denies it. this is affectionate banter.
we get a shared room for 0.5gp, and some bread+soup which are included.
her name: Danika.

we find a table. after a little while, two more people come inside and go to the bar, where they order pints of wine. Danika pours the wine, and we overhear them talking. They're wolf-hunters, and they killed several in the Svalich wood west of Vallaki, but more keep coming.

Their names are Szoldar and Yevgeni; Quiyra gives hers as well, then takes her leave and returns to our table.

Danika gets jumped from behind and sends a bowl of soup flying in our direction, at Oliver -  who catches it - and Areia - who gets splashed. Danika turns around to scold the little scamp - Bromin Bray, a small child in a wooden painted clown mask - who jumped her, and another boy nearby. Her sons, who were wearing masks and playing in the taproom, which they're not supposed to do. She shoos them away, into the kitchen.
Quiyra cleans up with prestidigitation, and Danika thanks us and offers wolf steaks on the house.

two clearly drunk men enter the taproom. one of them slams his hand on the bar. "my fellow vallakians! all is not well!"
the room abruptly quiets. the other man steps forward. "at least not until I've got a belly full of wide." a tense humorless chuckle in the taproom; other patrons return to their business.

the two approach the bar, where danika greets them by name - Karl and Nikolai - and asks them if they had too much to drink already. they complain, wanting more; the inn is running low. she offers purple grape mash #3, which they refuse. they want red dragon crush, which she pours, and she asks if their mother knows they're here. Karl says: our mother is far too busy these days, what she doesn't know can't hurt her. Oliver speaks up to admonish them, but doesn't really get through.

the husband exits the kitchen to talk to us. we compliment the tavern and food. he tells us that happiness is the centerpoint of vallaki.

what do we know about vallaki? few things. church here, lots barovian refugees. inn guy: yeah, refugees weren't granted access. Q: oh, why? guy, carefully: baron fears disease, stress, malicious unhappiness. Q: well, if he keeps them out there he'll certainly find all those things among them.

another man enters through the front door, remarkable: brightly colored, wearing puffy clothing half wine-red half blue, long blond mustache, long wavy blond hair, musketeer-style hat with pompous feather, bright smile, flamboyant demeanor. walks to the taproom, while greeting everyone by name with smiles. Nikolai and Karl catch sight of him, jeering: "It's the carnival man! tell us a story, carnival man!" a few more patrons join in. the man flourishes his cape, says "Who would Rictavio be, if he did not quench his thirst for revelry!"
he tells a tale: through forest on drusilla, his horse. heard on a breeze: voice siging beautiful memory. he followed it, deeper into woods. found source: a plant, gigantic, towering high, mouth to swallow a grown man whole, singing. by all the gods, cant believe his luck! a singing plant! just the oddity he was looking for! he approached it, and saw a man from his carnival - wilfred - approaching the plant. wilfred drops his trousrs and begins to... water the bushes. the plant was not amused, opened its mouth, and with one swift movement, swallowed wilfred whole! a moment of stunned silence, then the plant went back to singing. despite what he just saw, couldnt help laughing at the absurdity. and so the plant became the star of their show! carnival loved it.
he disappears.

some of us go to sleep, but quiyra sticks around for another while. Ireena comes in after around two hours. Q greets her, asks how the people are doing. Ireena: "it's complicated". explains lodging situation. Ireena pays for a room here, defers talk to tomorrow.
