## Day 3
we wake up early, to knocking at our door.

it's Irwin, the barkeep. quick chat with Quiyra and Areia, to warn us: be cautious while in vallaki. very strict rules in this city. most involve general happiness. Vargas (baron) thinks that happiness is the best way to keep the Devil away from the town, so any act "malicious unhappiness" - joke he may not like - any sign of unhappiness - is not taken well. also: festivals, carnivals, and such are mandatory in this town. in 4 days they'll have festival of blazing sun. if you are in the city, you're expected to be present. also: be careful of his men, especially his right hand Isaac Strazny. many have tried to test his strength, all have failed. also also: if we even need to earn the baron's favor, he's highly susceptible to flattery.

Jasper and Oliver catch the tail end of that.

We go downstairs for breakfast. Irwin is here. We smell fresh baked bread, there are jams to go with it, and a basket of a few (presumably) boiled eggs.

after a while, ireena comes down the stairs. she didn't sleep much - not because of the room, just trouble.

we discuss plans for today:
- ireena to [Church of Saint Andral](../Places/Church%20of%20Saint%20Andral.md), we'll go with her
- madam eva's request for a toy brought to her grandniece
- buy a map
- look into madam eva's prophecies:
	- town that is not well: this one? given the wording, yeah.
	- hilltop near mountain lake: around here?
	- oliver's monk: here?

Oliver asks Irwin for directions to the chuch: to the right, keep to the main road.
we exit. Quiyra looks at the roof, the raven isn't there.

the streets are full of people walking around. sound of a horse neighing down the street (the direction we have to go). a man with a royal demeanor; long white hair, heavily balding, combover. bright red cloak. riding a chestnut colored horse, flanked by two mastiffs, followed by 3 guards - 2 in back, 1 in front. guard in front is a big heavy man, wearing a cloak, hood up, face barely visible but strong features, arm outstretched. a woman got thrown aside, into a puddle of mud. the horse comes to a halt, and the procession stops. important detail: the outstretched arm is not human. it's a devilish red, covered in barbed wire. the baron has a disgusted look on his face, yells at the woman: you dare taint my cloak with your filthy peasant hands!? her voice, quavering: apologies, pls release my son, he meant no harm with foolish joke. baron: your son, name, needs rehabilitation for his malicious unhappiness! and a guess you do as well. demon arm guy steps forward, trying to take the woman. baron: throw her in the stocks! a few days will lighten her tongue. demon arm guy drags her back to her feet, throws her into the guard's arms. the guards pull her arms behind her back and frogmarch her off, southward. she struggles, weeps, cries for her son's freedom. whole town looks frozen. no one says a word or even tries to help. as the woman is hauled away, baron to townsfolk: let that be a lesson as to the dangers of malicious unhappiness! the devil's arm is long, but our happiness shall overcome his shadows! with a big smile, he continues: I expect to see you all at the festival of the blazing sun! All will be well! the townsfolk echo the call with forced smiles. He continues north with his mastiffs, devil arm guy, and a replacement guard. He passes in front of us. devil arm guy looks at us, gaze fixated for a long moment. he was looking specifically at ireena, he's uncomfortable.

ireena holds tight to her cloak: something felt familiar about devil arm guy. we speculate: perhaps he works for strahd, perhaps he had something to do with ireena's old life.

we follow irwin's directions. find a centuries-old stone church, bulging steeple in the back, cracks in the walls, stained-glass saints, wrought-iron fence enclosing graveyard. full of mists, of course. depictions of the sun, this is a church of lathander.

we approach the door and enter. long hallway, single nave. two lines of pews. in the final part, a statue of a man with his hands outstretched, behind him a large stone sun. church is quite empty, very few people here. the priest is setting up for a service, and has a little boy helping him.

Ireena goes forward, goes straight to the priest. She greets him, introduces herself as daughter of Burgomaster Antonovich. Glances at us, then asks the priest for refuge in the church. The priest asks her to follow him, and they walk off up the spiral stairs. We wait a few minutes, and she returns with a puzzled look on her face. Talk not go as expected? She thinks the father will want to speak to us too. Before we go up, she hands us a coin pouch: payment for taking her here. Quiyra pockets it for splitting later. It's 100gp.

We go up. The priest has a somewhat submissive look on his face, embarrassed. Ireena informed him that she's seeking shelter in this church. While he would love to grant this permanently, recent events have left the church wards in a precarious state. A: qhat type of events? F: ysee, church is normally hallowed ground, protected by Lathander blessings; stops fiends, undead, etc from entering. Also keeps them from charming, frightening, or possessing those within. source of the protection is the crypt of St Andral, which historically held the blesed bones of Andral (foudner of church). this morning he found the bones missing. once he has to renew the protection: 1/year, at dawn, on the morning of st andral's feast, which is 4 days from now.  same as blazing sun festival. F: it looks like someone broke in. Only he knew of the bones' existence; however, after news of the siege in barovia a few days ago, he shared the knowledge with Jeska, the child that lives here. He just learned of the bones' location. He takes full responsibility, and knows he shouldn't ask, but could really use some help. Ireena told him a lot about us, which is why he decided to ask. He and Oliver exchange blessings in the name of their respective gods.

the father kindly shoos everyone out, one by one, asking for some time in order to get the function ready for the day and other such mediocre excuses. then he locks the front door and takes us to a trapdoor (covered by a rug) behind the altar.

Oliver: any significance between the saint and the upcoming festival, any idea what the thief might want the remains for? F: baron just took the holy day and, since andral was a powerful believer in the morning lord, baron decided to honor him with the festival. other q: he doesn't know. Father hasn't been able to make heads or tails of this himself.

we descent into the crypt. stony walls stained with moisture. oliver casts light so we can all see better.

quiyra and areia notice: theres plenty of clumps of earth shaped like large footprints. bootprints (adult size) have blades of green grass and white flower petals.
at end of corridor is a grave, different from the others. left open. empty. in it, oliver finds a few strands of dark black hair. jasper takes samples of it.
the boy has dirty blond hair, doesn't match the hair in the grave.

quiyra finds spiders and begins casting speak with animals. in the meantime, the others go talk to the boy, led by oli.

father: find anything?
oli: a few things, nothing specific yet. got a few more questions though.
were the bones the only thing taken?
father: yes
oli: only person you told was the boy. any issue with me talking to him?
father: no, but please be patient and gentle.
oli: that's my job, no worry.
oli heads over to the boy.
oli: hi, im a friend of your father. just want to ask a few qs. what's your name?
boy: Yeska!
oli: father told me he told you about the crypt. did you tell anyone else?
boy: no.
oli: nobody? no friends?
boy: no.
oli: noone with black hair? (persuasion 23)
boy: well, I told Milivoj, 3 days ago.
father: the other kid that works here. but he didn't come to work today.
oli: he tell you about anything he took form down there?
boy: no
oli: where does Milivoj live?
father: close by, NW quarter of Vallaki. he's a good kid.
father: if you find the bones' location, please come get me. I'll be waiting here.

spider time
do the spiders often see things my shape down here? yes
i show the spiders the grass&petals. this smell, when? today.
before today? yes
when first? yesterday.
spider, how old? before yesterday. long.
spider: today, five you. yesterday, two you.
the mes yesterday, bigger or smaller than me? big.
describe smell. spider walks on quiyra's neck, touches a drop of sweat. this!
quiyra thanks the spider, it leaves. she goes back upstairs.

we update each other on our respective conversations.

quiyra to priest: pls describe bones. it's a full skeleton, well-cleaned.

quiyra casts locate object: well-cleaned full skeleton.

we go to milivoi's house, takes ~10 minutes. shortly before arriving, quiyra does sense a skeleton, toward the south-west. this part of the city is rough and uneven. roads irregular, houses grimier, more dilapidated. smell of damp wood.
reach decrepit structure sagging beneath its weight, timbers rotting, windows cracked and filthy. front: ramshackle wooden door, slightly askew in its frame, atop a small muddy porch.
we knock on the door. no answer. then the door groans open: gaunt, glassy-eyed woman. hair matted with grease, painted beaded necklace. behind her: 3 young children, wrestling and shouting in cramped living space with old threadbare stuff. 2 more chldren: adolescent boy with long shaggy hair, similar age girl with cracked glasses. they peer curiously around a pair of patchwork armchairs.
oli: sorry to bother you, looking for milivoj. she turns to two of the kids, grunts at them, leaves the door. the kids come. one of them says: milivoj is sick, doesn't want to talk to anyone. 
oli: it's really important, unfortunately. also I am a healer.
girl turns aroud, yells: milo! someone want to speak to you!
few moments later, teenage boy (16ish) with muscular build comes out from a wooden door at the back of the room. small boy on his shoulders, two twin sisters hanging from his biceps.
as he meets our gaze, his face visibly falls, and he gently shakes the other kids off. he reaches the door.
oli invites him to talk outside. he accepts.
oli: so, you can probably guess what we're here for.
miivoj shakes his head
oli: some items of interest to the father have gone missing from the church today.
milivoj: i know nothing. he tries to move back inside.
quiyra can't read him / areia can tell he's full of shit
areia blocks his way and calls him out.
oli reassures him: we're not going to do anything to you. just investigating.
quiyra: we are planning to get the bones back.
milivoj: i know nothing. just saw a cloaked figure watching the church from an alleyway a few days ago.
oli: was the figure listening in on conversation between you and yeska?
milivoj: probably
jasper: when was the last time you went under the church?
milivoj: never. I had no idea we had an underchurch.
jasper checks hair samples. shrug, they're both dark.
oliver: more reassurance.
milivoj gives in: yeah I took them.
areia: and why?
milivoj: you seen the shithole I live in? after dad wounded in attack, I needed money.
oli: and who'd you sell to?
milivoj: the coffin maker.
areia points in the bones' direction: this way?
milivoj: yeah
oli: who is the coffin maker, where's his workshop?
milivoj: we traded at the workshop.
quiyra: which is where?
milivoj: she (areia) knows the direction
oli: address would be nice
milivoj: town square, hard to miss. father lucien can take you there. or I can take you.
we admonish him for his choices.
before we leave, areia asks milivoj how much he got paid, with some prodding: 30 gp.
we leave him be.
we go to the coffin maker.

on the way, we chat about growing up in poverty.

we change our minds and head back to Father Lucien to inform him, as he requested. we summarize what we found. he wants to go get them right away, and insists on accompanying us even in case a fight breaks out. he assures us he can defend himself.

we arrive. windows barred, door barred. we knock on the door, no answer.
we discuss what's up with this

father lucien: the shop was open, we often met with Edric.
last time shop was open: 2 days ago. also when he last saw edric.

inside we see a normal interior. wooden floor, lotsa workbenches, coffins, a sort of warehouse. a kitchen / dining room. not just a shop, but also a home.
quiyra sends in a spider summon to explore everything. there's nothing there, all of the coffins are open and empty. no bones, no suspicious humanoid figures, nothing.
upstairs: boxes. two of them contain corpses.
an old man, eating breakfast.
spider walks up the old man's leg. he smells alive, and doesn't notice.
spider waits at top of stair landing.

areia gets the ladder, climbs up to the window of the room the old man is in, and knocks on the window. he looks at her with crazed eyes. She waves. He shouts, muffled: "I'm closed!" and shuts the curtains.

we go to Plan Fuck It, which is Areia breaking down a door. She fails, but we do get a reaction: the old man rushing down. He shouts: "I'm closed, leave me be!"
Jasper insists: open the door now.
Oli: we're not here for business, we know you have the bones.
he threatens to call the guards
Q: we know about he corpses in boxes upstairs, we know you bought the bones of st andral.
he relents, but says we must promise to protect him. from the vampires.
bones are in a secret compartment in his wardrobe. we agree to this.
he lets us in through the window of the kitchen/dining room.

oli: why vampired in workshop?
h: i've been threatened. by a vampire.
areia: a vampire, or *the* vampire?
h: not the devil.
q: and what did this vampire want?
h: didn't say goals. just get the bones and wait.
q: what's with the corpses in the boxes upstairs?
h: those are the vampires that threatened him
q: i only found two of the vampires, where's the third?
h insists the third one is also in that room upstairs.

we all know about stake to the heart. other things: running water, sunlight.

quiyra asks henrik for wooden stakes. he has some.
oliver casts shield of faith on himself, quiyra casts power word tiptoe so we can sneak better.

areia goes up to the first vampire spawn box and cleaves at it with her glaive. she slices through the box, and the blade cuts into the corpse. hit for 9 slashing. combat!
