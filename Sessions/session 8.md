THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE

Areia lifts up Oliver and runs out carrying him. Quiyra speeds to get the bones. Jasper leaves calmly. The coffinmaker made it out too.

outside, we cast about for solutions. We shout FIRE!
People gather. A bucket brigade forms. However, it's too little too late.

Father Lucien stares deep into the coffinmakers eyes. "You will face your consequences. But you will claim that you were smoking your pipe and it fell." He looks at us, too. "I don't think there is a way I can thank you enough for what you've done."

Oliver bandages himself unsteadily and gets back on his feet.

Quiyra checks with Father Lucien: talk of vampires not a good idea around here? he confirms: pretend there were never any vampires in vallaki.

Father Lucien apologizes for being out of healing. Areia insists on helping oliver walk; he accepts a shoulder to lean on.

We get back to the Church of St Andral, and get down to the crypt. He takes the bundle of bones from Quiyra, and begins unwrapping it. The bones are clean, white, and polished; he puts them in their rightful place, closes the sarcophagus, and says a small blessing to the Morning Lord. He thanks us again for recovering the bones.

He assures us that Ireena is welcome to stay here as long as she wishes, and that the town is a little safer now.

Quiyra notes that the town can't really be safe as long as all must be well. Father Lucien hedgingly admits that the baron might not be fit for this place.

Lady Vakta, the other contestant. She's of royal descent, no idea if she'd be better than the baron though.

church would fit not so many people comfortably in beds, but the pews could be rearranged to fit more - 30ish at most.

we discuss getting the refugees inside the city. Areia proposes sneaking them in with a distraction, but that'd be a lot of people to distract and also the baron would kill them as soon as we found out.

We plot treason (rebellion?) for a bit.

Father Lucien begs off from our discussion, saying he should not be hearing this.

We agree that we shouldn't do anything just yet, but this government needs to go. Gathering information and tending to our other goals would be good.

Oliver drifts on the edge of consciousness.

we rest for a bit. quiyra goes out to get some warm pies.

Quiyra goes up to find Ireena, who's getting settled in. Does she want to come along on our toy errand?

We go toward Bliski's Toys. Shortly before the BLue? inn, we find a hanging sign inscribed 'Blinski Toys'. Through the dirty glass, we see a display of toys. They all bear a tag with the slogan "it's no fun if no blinsky!"

inside is a portly man with a half-purple, half-green jester-like outfit. He looks quite happy.

We enter. The bell above the door rings, and the man greets us jovially, with a rhyming slogan (he practiced).

There are many dolls. Notably including:
- a headless doll, with a set of heads to swap in. 9 cp.
- miniature gallows, w/trapdoor and weighed hangman
- wooden nesting dolls, smaller ones being older all the way to a mummified corpse
- wooden string mobile of hanging bats with flapping wings
- windup merry-go-round, of wolves chasing children
- ventriloquist dummy of strahd: 9 sp, his masterpiece, inspired by his master: the great toymaker fritz von bahn(?). according to rumour: his greatest invention is a clockwork man, still around somewhere. if we find it, would we bring it to him? in exchange, he'll make us any toy we desire.
- doll that looks remarkably like ireena.

Ireena is quite fixated on the doll in her likeness. We agree. Quiyra asks Blinsky about it. He deflects, saying it's not for sale. Quiyra clarifies: we're not looking to buy it, just wondering why it looks so much like our friend here. He admits it's a commissioned piece, it's not done, and he doesn't want to reveal the commissioner's identity; but the commissioner did specify the doll's appearance. Oliver insists, pointing out Ireena's presence and perhaps the deserves and explanation? Unfortunately this fails to sway the man; we decide to leave it.

Oliver suggests the stuffed bunny in the corner. Areia spots a toy axe. We have a random side discussion about child weapons.

Quiyra pushes things forward and we buy the bunny (9 cp). Blinsky tries to sell us the strahd dummy, but we decline ("I feel like that thing's going to kill me in my sleep" - Oliver).

Ireena is getting uncomfortable and we're about done here anyway, so we leave. As we 

We spot Isac Strazny (sp?) again, with two guards. They're posting proclamations in the town square, ripping off some old posters and putting up new ones. The city isn't that busy, but still much more lively than Barovia was.

Posters near us: the new ones. Depiction of a sun as the background, above it the words:
> COME ONE, COME ALL,
> to the greatest celebration of the year:
> THE FESTIVAL OF THE BLAZING SUN!
> Attendance and children required.
> Rain or shine.
> ALL WILL BE WELL!

Jasper and Quiyra check over the toy. It's not magical, and Jasper finds no suspicious lumps either.

Quiyra talks to the guards at the other gate: is there a toll for leaving? will there be another for returning? no; no, if we register our exit. We do so, leaving our names and stating that we should be back before nightfall. He records them on a paper, which he affixes to a post. Quiyra also asks where the Vistani camp is: left, in the woods.

large clearing, small grassy hill with houses into the side, elegantly carved woodwork, lanterns hanging on the walls. atop the hill, barrel-top wagons surrounding a large tent with smoke coming from a hole in the top.
the tent is brightly lit. even from here, we can smell wine and horses.

As we approach, we notice in front of the house: three figures, gray cloaks, angular features, black flowing hair half hidden under their cowls. They're probably not human, possibly of elvish descent but not looking like any (traditional) elf we're used to. They see us, notice us, and don't seem to care very much.

We ignore them and go up to the center. There are sounds of talking. Quiyra checks with a summoned mouse first. We hear the sound of splintering wood and shattering ceramic. There are three campfires burning low with embers, 6 Vistani around the hearth, watching the source of the commotion: a shirtless young man kneeling on the dead grass, eyes downcast, face pale. Beside him, a broken wooden crate amid a pile of broken pottery shards, some still wobbling. A dozen feet away, an older man in studded leather with a thick well-trimmed beard, eyes bloodshot, right hand trembling, leaning on a makeshift wooden crutch, lower right leg wrapped in bloodstained bandages. he says: "you were supposed to keep her safe!" his hands grabs blindly, as if casting around for something to throw.

Quiyra aborts the scouting, and we dash in.

Another man looks at us. Calm, long hair, tidy goatee. He asks if we're travelers: yes. What's our business here? Quiyra: originally, delivering a toy to arabell, but she seems to be missing?
angry fist guy confirms, she's missing. The young man was tasked with watching her play in the woods, but instead he got drunk, and when he woke up she was gone.

Quiyra offers our help. The calmer man reassures the angry man: "see? there are still good souls in the world."

We ask how drunk the young man was - totally wasted, he knows nothing.

The calmer man takes us outside, presenting us with a chalice of wine - which we decline. He takes a sip, thugh.

A longtime member of the encampment gave alexei (floor boy) some wine, and had vanished when alexei awoke.

calm man (Arrigel) led the search with >12 vistani, nearly as many of the dusk elves. coudnlt find her, but Savid (one of the dusk elves) found the decapitated body of the vanished guy, near the Luna river surrounded by signs of a fight. Also found a strange signet ring, which he gave to Casimir (the leader of the dusk elves, a scholar, hoping he could identify it). The symbol: Casimir can show us. A sort of triangle with lots of lines.
He has a lead: the baron of vallaki has quite the impressive library. could probably ID the signet ring with access to the library. Ireena is our best shot at getting (legit) access, those of us who aren't Areia can read.

Arabell disappeared three (!) days ago. Quiyra points out that she's probably dead; he says they'd still want her body rather than nothing, then. He suggests we speak to Casimir; we do. He's in the house we passed. Arrigel mentions that Arabell is his niece.

Quiyra gives him the gift for safekeeping, also explaining that Madam Eva sent it (and us). He takes it reverently and puts it away in his wagon.

Plan:
- chat to casimir
- library access.
