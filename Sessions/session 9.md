## Day 3
we go to casimir. he's in the first house seen up the hill, with the lantern and the three figures.

we enter, passing the three figures wordlessly. it's small, cozy, quite warm - in contrast to chil mists. hanging sketches,portraits of darkskinned elves. three ? carved of dark wood, constellations&celestial bodies. two dark brown curtains hide the entrance from another chamber beyond, lit&heated by fireplace. old green rug before fire, old wooden table, some chairs. left wall: ~12 cubbyholes with leatherbound books, small wooden statuettes of elven figures. right wall: faded tapestry of a lush and beautiful forest beneath noonday sun. sitting on the rug, another dusk elf, face partially lit by the fire.

he opens his eyes. we introduce ourselves, and explain why we're here: came with a gift for arabell, found her missing, signet ring?
he bids us sit down, then pulls out a small pouch. inside: a small iron/steel ring, intricate symbol: two triangles, resembling a star.
left: symbol of the evocation school; right: necromancy school.
however the ring doesn't respond to magic in any way; it's not magical.
casimir has a black eye, several cuts across cheek, right hand&forearm pale bluish white with skin puffy and blistered.
he tried to identify what it may mean but has had no luck.
he finds it strange that he can't, since he knows much about pre-barovian heraldry.

he gives it to us, he has a copy of the design anyway. we thank him and head off toward the library.

back to the city, no issues at the gate. the baron's mansion is easy enough to find and reach.
we let ireena take the lead, with a *guidance* from Jasper.
she knocks on the door and almost immediately a woman opens it. Ireena introduces herself and asks to be received by Baron Vargas ?name?. The maid acquiesces. Ireena enters and gestures at us to follow; we do.

The maid leads us to a receiving room, where she asks us to wait while she fetches the baron.
the room: padded chairs and couches, a cozy fur rug (probably a bear), smell of pipe smoke, head of an angry-looking brown bear on the wall.

We sit, and shortly the maid returns, followed by the man we saw before: Baron Vargas, joining with a regal look on his face and regal demeanor. He's also followed by two large mastiffs.

He welcomes and recognizes Ireena. She greets him and introduces us after he asks, stating that we escorted her here. He welcomes us to with a gesture.
He sits down, and the mastiffs flop onto the floor. He asks what she wants to discuss.

She has two matters:
1. her people outside the gate - she asks him to allow them in, he refuses. he explains that they would be a seed of malicious unhappiness. but he is not evil; he will allow her in and out to her liking, without needing to pay a toll each time. she swallows her anger and continues to the next topic.
2. her friends (we) are outsiders. (she flounders for a bit). they're scholars, mages, and reliable people; and they are looking to learn more about this land. you have quite the extensive library; would you mind if they spent some time there? that is a request he can grant, but on one condition: we must resolve a problem his. for the past 2 months, a spirit has haunted the Vallakovich mansion. reflections in mirrors, darkened windows; cold drafts, strange sounds, things moving on their own. even lost a butler! and another servant, they were too fearful of the ghost to continue working here.

his wife, the baroness, hosts daily lunches for a group of vallakian women. he asks us not to mention the spirit if we're ever in their presence, nor to people outside. we accept this.
the last person to see the spirit was the cook.
he appoints the maid claudia as our guide - she already knows about the ghost, of course.
q: did anything happen two months ago? not that he knows of.
j: baron, can you describe the spirit? no, he's never seen it himself. servants just say "humanoid figure,"
a: anyone die near the manor 2 months ago? not that he knows of.

we take our leave, and split:
areia + quiyra to the cook
jasper + oliver to the library

claudia leads j+o upstairs, and points a+q to the kichen door. we enter: it's quite well-equipped.
we see the cook, wearing a white apron. she notices us; we explain why we're here.
she sighs. "scary thing, you know?" and asks what we want to know
ghost shows itself on the 2nd floor
some of the servants also heard it in the attic at night.
cook was getting an old pot from the attic last week. felt a presence, a cold draft, the sound of breathing. was about the quit the job at that point.
a: who lives here? the baron, his wife, their son, and the servants.
two of the servants quit. one of them - valentina - said she saw the spirit in the baroness' mirror, so the mirror was hidden inthe attic. spirit looked like distorted silhouette of a young woman.
its hauntings feel like sorrow, loneliness, and longing.
manor has three floors: first, second, attic.
hauntings on the 2nd floor: mostly near the attic, yes.
few people enter the attic anymore, mostly the baron's son.
a: oh, what's he like? he eats too little, strangely isolated for a young man his age. especially since strange illness struck daughter of lady fiona, wachter, 3 months ago; she and victor got along very well. they might've been an item. illness was something strange; she died quickly.
running theory: the ghost might be the young lady's.
a: how go attic? second floor, ladder inside burgomaster's room.

meanwhile, jasper and oliver are led through the upstairs hallway - neat, clean, good-looking. claudia opens the door to the library.
floor-to-ceiling shelves lining every wall, no windows. astounding number of books. desk with brass oil lamp and padded chair.
jasper and oliver search the library. fairly soon, jasper finds nothing containing info about the ring, but one book does catch his attention: a genealogical tome of vallakian families. one name stands out: Ireena Strazni, younger sister of Izeek Strazni, other siblings Grigori and Fatima. died >18yrs ago, at age of 4, Grigori+Fatima followed soon (suicide by hanging). cause of death for Ireena unknown, presumed eaten by wolves.
soon after, another person enters the library: young man, dismissive look in his eyes, nice elaborate cloak, long wavy hair in a ponytail, ruff at the neck, holding a book. introductions: this guy is victor.
he casts about the room, picks up a book - and jasper notices: the book he entered with has the ring's symbol on it. jasper asks to look at it, victor asks why.
cook's name: Tereska
around this time, quiyra and areia finish speaking to the cook and go join J+O in the library.

jasper: heard of a symbol like that, would like to take a closer look.
victor: yes but what does that have to do with my book?
q: we would like to know what this symbol means or relates to, book could probably help
victor: but why should
a: similar interests?
victor: I don't think my book is any of your concern. he turns to leave.
q: you're trying to bring her back, aren't you?
victor: is confused. who? what do you know?
q: explains: lady fiona's daughter, she died ~3 months ago of a mysterious illness, you were quite close. also personally i suspect the ghost in this estate is hers.
victor: fine, follow me.

we follow him to a room, where he mage hands open a trapdoor in the ceiling. a staircase to the attic is revealed.

the attic is dusty and cluttered, wooden rafters shrouded with cobwebs. old forgotten things draped in white sheets. barrels, crates, trunks, furniture, etc - and a clear footpath through the mess, which victor walks through.
at areia's question, explains: this is his workroom, he likes a bit of isolation. he's been using it since he was a child.
he looks at a door, back to us, slouches, and whispers something to the door.
he opens that door too, and lets us in. old mismatched furniture arranged into a dusty study
parchment with strange diagrams, freestanding bookshelf with collection of bones
dusty rug, pine box on which lounges a skeletal (undead) cat.
quite the ancient book atop the desk.
