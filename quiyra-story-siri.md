This is the story of a girl who spent fifty years running away from home and herself.

Siri grew up in the city of splendors, among a people not her own. Her parents - adopted - tried to love her, but she was an awkward girl, never comfortable with herself. She fit neither her clothes nor her place in society.

Now a young woman, Siri thought she might find herself on the road. She told her parents farewell and left her ill-fitting clothes behind, with the never-right splendor of the city they belonged to. She kept only a few mementos of her time as a young girl.

Siri traveled and traveled, up and down the Sword Coast. So many cities she saw, so many ways of life. None of them were hers.

Until, one month, her travels took her to the deep forest, where her distant kin dwelt. The woods sang to her a long-forgotten song. Had she finally found her true home?

No. She stayed for three months, and still something was not right. It had nothing to do with the stubborn elders she was arguing trade deals with.

And yet she remained, hoping to finally find her place. Instead, it was his place that found him. A local woman had taken interest in him. They spoke of shared experiences, and she had an uncanny insight into his longing.

Not long after, she dragged him before the elders. They were like entirely different people; no longer stubborn, but helpful and kind. He left the assembly a whole new man.

And they lived happily ever after.
